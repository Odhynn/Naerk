## History

As first materials emerged, al interactions were at a conflict. A main struggle was why fire repels cold but also goes out if it loses from it, water becomes ice, and why the other two elements are not so strongly affected by cold. This was because the [[Fyrlean|Lord of Fire]] in the first phase of the [[Primordial War|War]] had intense feuds with the Cold Queen Fallfaunt, perhaps even more intense than [[Hydarax]], the Lord of Water.
In the second phase of the War the Cold Lady realizing that the Elemental Lords were gaining ground in the war took advantage of the "common enemy" she had with the Elemental Lord of Water and saw an opportunity for an alliance. By the time the second phase was over the two of them - although they had managed to contain the Lord of Fire, where after the victory he managed and the sun was created and one would call him undeniably superior, in one move their power reached similar levels.

One of the results of the battle was Fallfaunt falling in love with Hydarax. But the Lord of Fire, realizing that the two were weakened after their battle with the other primordials, decided to take revenge and attacked the weaker and weakened of the two, the Cold Queen. Fires engulfed his abode and as Fallfaunt collapsed, Hydarax surrounded her with water and pushed the Lord of Fire away with all his might. Then the water took a new form for the first time, that of ice, which, though it did not extinguish the burning flames, still known as frozen flames, constitutes the eternal prison of Fallfaunt. The Water Lord decided to keep the imprisoned Cold Queen as a source of power and many believe he is still in love with her.

However, her imprisonment angered her, as she was now a captive of Hydarax. So Fallfaunt is often not as friendly as it used to be. As long as she retains even a little power in the material dimension, her cold freezes lakes, kills animals and plants, and attacks civilizations. At one point, she allied herself with Voolthow to escape and take revenge on those who brought her to this state. An alliance that Voolthow exploited to further increase his power and his undead armies, without helping her at all. Fallfaunt, then, embittered, gave up her endeavours, and contented herself with filling the roofs of houses with snow, freezing the seas far from the influence of the sun, and blowing with her icy wind the cloaks of travellers.

But she eventually found another opportunity to enter [[Material Plane]] and take revenge, with the help of her Avatar and her witch Tyara, in [[Winter's War]]. After that critical moment, that almost ruined [[Naerk]], she was granted another way out, by going to the [[Evergrowing Forest]] instead and taking her place as an [[Aspect]].
