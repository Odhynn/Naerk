## Formation

When the Sun materialized, as the Fyrlean defeated the Primordial [[Querligon]], a part of the Fire Lord's existence passed into the sun. As his flames transformed into this form, he found the embodiment eating away at more and more of his strength and threatening to consume him and swallow him whole. Thus, he was forced to stop, and found that a piece of himself had passed into the [[Material Plane]]. He tried to take control, but saw that he was now another entity, with his own will. And this entity was called Reszek, the lord sun.

Reszek was initially quite weak, and it was feared that he was vulnerable to possible attacks. He quickly found that without allies, he could not survive long in the material plane, and he did not have enough power to create his own. In his quest to find allies, he turned to [[Malahir]], with whom he made a pact of mutual protection. According to it, Reszek was able to control the distance of the sun and the strength of the radiation so that the surface of Na'erk had a friendly temperature in which living organisms could evolve and multiply. Naerk would enter such an orbit from the sun that would allow Malahir to expand and evolve the first organisms on its surface. With the creation of life, Reszek with a crucial part in it found his powers and influence growing.He assumed the difficult responsibility of protecting creation and life, in which he too had now laid his foundation stone. Periodically he varied the strength of the sun's brightness and radiation according to the needs of the living organisms on Naerk.

## Devotees

When the first souls appeared, the sun lord considered that life had reached its ultimate stage. He found himself patronizing the cultures as he saw how they could reach unique levels of artistry and beauty, observing the constructions, sculptures, poems, music. He therefore took on the task of protecting those civilizations that had such ultimate goals, beyond cannibalism, mere survival, and the destruction of everything beautiful. At the same time, he hosted many great heroes in the Golden Palace from time to time, and especially in the beginning when the armies of demons, devils and their servants were sowing terror in the material dimension, he protected and guided those who asked for his help. Reszek is worshiped in numerous places across all Na'erk, with many altars dedicated to the glory of the Sun. Priests, paladins and pilgrims aid the weak and help those in need in daily basis.
