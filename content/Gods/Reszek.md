## Formation

When the Sun materialized, as the Fyrlean defeated the Primordial [[Querligon]], a part of the Fire Lord's existence passed into the sun, Reszek. Reszek was initially quite weak, and it was feared that he was vulnerable to possible attacks. In his quest to find allies, he turned to [[Malahir]], with whom he made a pact of mutual protection. According to it, Reszek was able to control the distance of the sun and the strength of the radiation so that the surface of Na'erk had a friendly temperature in which living organisms could evolve and multiply. With the creation of life, Reszek with a crucial part in it found his powers and influence growing.

## Devotees

Reszek is worshiped in numerous places across all Na'erk, with many places dedicated to the glory of the Sun. Priests, paladins and pilgrims aid the weak and help those in need in daily basis.
