A sovereign archangel that fought numerous times over countless millenia the fiend armies of [[Hell]] and [[Abyss]]. Shee was respected and honored in [[Fortress of the Just]] as a great strategist and entity of valor. She took part in the [[Unnamed Judgement]] to punish the abuse of the [[Rod of Stone and Steel]] and used her [[Solarium Ring]] to bind and lock the Rod.

At the [[Bloodline War]] when the demons slaughtered the archpriestess [[Taira]] and the faithful people and clergy en masse, they forced her hand, and she arrived with her ally, [[Nalshar]] to protect the [[Darrok]] army and protect their retreat.

Upon her death, she was reincarnated into the powerful [[Le-Hara]] celestial emissary.
