A sovereign archangel that fought numerous times over countless millenia the fiend armies of [[Hell]] and [[Abyss]]. Shee was respected and honored in [[Fortress of the Just]] as a great strategist and entity of valor. She took part in the [[Unnamed Judgement]] to punish the abuse of the [[Rod of Stone and Steel]] and used her [[Solarium Ring]] to bind and lock the Rod. Upon her death, she was reincarnated into the powerful [[Le-Hara]] celestial emissary.
