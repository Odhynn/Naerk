A lot has been said about the Unknown God. That he is a Primordial, that he was created by one, that he does not even exist are some of the most popular hypotheses of what and who he is. One thing is certain, however, that those who glorify him and especially his clerics are perfect at keeping secrets as well as creating them. It is no coincidence that in every temple of Steenar that has been investigated, a disproportionate number of secret rooms and passages have been found. Every Steenar believer has two core values:

**1) Every piece of information gains value the less people know about it.**
**2) Any information becomes useful the less people know about it.**

That is, a believer of Steenar will not miss an opportunity to obtain any information about anything and will often seek it, but will never give it to anyone for any reason, many times even if his life is depending on it. The operation structure of his chain of temples is also unknown for the most part. What we know of him is that he probably has an arch-cleric, though no one knows who it is, except the one he himself undertakes to appoint the next, the first time he himself becomes arch-cleric, or often as soon as he knows he will be. There is a supreme council of clerics - in which the chief cleric attends but does not necessarily reveal that he is among the clergy - which undertakes to make decisions in relation to the issues that concern the faithful. Steenar's temples may be everywhere and in any form, but they are always hidden. Some of the places where his temples have been found are often inside cities that look like houses on the outside, in forests built like treehouses in places that are not easy to see, or even inside caves. These are usually abandoned or other times the reason they stop working is that their location has been found. Finally, a Steenar believer is by no means ashamed to reveal that he believes in him, contrary to what many think, but he will not do so easily.

*A story found carved into a temple, which is a typical example of how a believer works, told of a murder of one of the wives of a rich man. He offered a reward to whoever found the murderer, and then a believer appeared to investigate. Two days later he found the man and told him "it's time for me to go." The man replied "but you haven't found the killer yet and according to your principles you wouldn't leave if you didn't find him". "So if I leaveâ€¦ what does that mean?" he replied and left.*
