## History

The Destroyer, tried to enforce his role against [[Nahema]], his sister, to destroy creation. His was [[Styx]], the Trap of Souls, and numerous other plots to destroy existence. He gave power and fury to Karadosh, he aided the [[Chosen]] [[Archdemons]] at the [[Demonic Civil War]], and he tried with all his power to annihilate [[Neverborn]], to no avail, resulting in the creation of the first undead. Most of his ways of influencing the [[Material Plane|Material World]] are subtle and indirect, as defined by his creator, the [[Equalizer]].

When Amehan's attempt to destroy souls with the Styx failed, he was forced to resort to other means. He had to adjust to a reality where not only most of the gods were against him, but even more so his direct intervention in the [[Material Plane]] would have little success and disastrous consequences for him as well. So he had to start all over again. Hiding deep in [[Tartara]], he was preparing his revenge. Among his troops were several titans, huge [[Primordial War|primordial]] creatures with many powers, but not enough to make his move. He was able to find a way to create through the Styx a portal to the [[Material Plane]], but even then his powers were not enough to carry out an invasion.

But then began the war between demons and devils in the upper levels of the [[Tartara]]: The [[Eternal Slaughter]]. The blood fell in endless crimson cascades down the cliffs, ramps, and chasms, and reached the lower levels of the plane. Amehan quickly found that this blood, as well as the corpses of the dead, had a power not to be trifled with: they were composed of souls that had been greatly corrupted by strife and conflict, and in Tartarus every soul was rightfully his and he could shape it as desired.

So Amehan and his titans set to work, and began to sculpt the remains of the battle into a hideous and bloodthirsty army: the first [[Vulga]], made by his own hands, and the [[Erevi]], created by the Titans, with each. to give his own particular approach of violence, corruption and destruction to his warriors. And by the time the Eternal Slaughter ended, their army was ready.

Then, his Titan hordes opened a huge rift in the earth and attacked the Material Plane from the place where [[Paraselt]] is today. The invasion took place in the year -1275 and was called [[The Eruption]]. With a huge volcanic eruption, the Vulga and the Erevi poured out of the mountains to the east and west and began to wreak havoc in their path. At the same time, lava, rocks and ash began to devastate vast areas of forest.

The realms in the material plane were caught off guard. The ancient kingdom of [[Aldaron]] was completely destroyed, and the capital city of Kilmahara was covered in ash and volcanic ash. The souls of the dead were stolen by the Titans and Vulga, and sent to Tartarus to create new warriors. Their advance continued, but the [[Gate]] from [[Tartara]] was closed when the lava solidified in the Volcano. Replenishing the Amehan army became impossible, and when the archangels [[Li-Tithlamir]] and [[Lo-Ukmasid]] appeared from the [[Fortress of the Just]] a fierce battle was fought in nowadays [[Rammok]], involving three human countries and the centaur kingdom to stop the advance of Amehan forces, which desolated the area with the spells used on it.

In the end, after many human and centaur sacrifices, as well as Li-Tithlamir's, the Vulga were defeated. Of the eight titans leading the army, only three were able to escape and survive, hiding in remote places on Naerk. As for Amehan, he realized after his defeat that the only way he could gain power again would be to steal the souls of the dead. Thus, he has created many spells with which he tries to steal the souls of the dead and recruit them into his Vulga-like hordes. Many of these are utilised by his few followers in the material plane to send him the souls of their victims, drawing the wrath of most gods and mortals.
