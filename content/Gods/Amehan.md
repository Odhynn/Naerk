## History

The Destroyer, tried to enforce his role against [[Nahema]], his sister, to destroy creation. His was [[Styx]], the Trap of Souls, and numerous other plots to destroy existence. He gave power and fury to Karadosh, he aided the [[Chosen]] [[Archdemons]] at the [[Demonic Civil War]], and he tried with all his power to annihilate [[Neverborn]], to no avail, resulting in the creation of the first undead. Most of his ways of influencing the [[Material Plane|Material World]] are subtle and indirect, as defined by his creator, the [[Equalizer]].
