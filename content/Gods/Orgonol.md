When [[Sergonial]] freed himself from his obligations to Yerastu, [[Orgonol]] bowed. Drowning in blood after the [[Eternal Slaughter|difficult battle]] against the [[demons]], he heard him say that "we are not inferior to anyone" and understood that this is indeed the way to make a better world. They would stop using souls for "boosts" without the approval of the souls themselves.

Powerful in battle, but low in rank, he immediately attracted Sergonial's attention. The first thing Sergonial did, after creating [[Hell]], was to see which of his allies were ready to fight even after the [[Eternal Slaughter]], so he rearranged the hierarchy based on strength, not underestimating the rational abilities that some had. As soon as he saw Orgonol not even have a scratch on him he thought he was a coward. But soon with the use of magic he learned that he had been on the front line all along.

"You deserve at least a platoon and certainly more in time," he told him.

"I don't want, I don't think it's right for me to be the one to give orders, anyone who wants can ask for my opinion." he answered him.

"Respected" Sergonial said and continued to supervise the [[devils]].

The next day Sergonial visited Orgonol and told him “Now that we don't have unlimited souls, we must secure our access to them, as it is the only way to ensure that there will be other devils in the future. How do you think we should manage it?"

“We want to make a better world right? We can ask the souls themselves who want the same to help us. It will be like making their dream come true, in exchange for them helping us to do it together. I'm sure this will be a deal they can't refuse. It's not a big problem that we can't go to Styx to ask them. We can go to the material dimension, where the rules of Yerastu are heard only by those who want to. I'm sure many will agree to help us build a better world." Orgonol replied looking Sergonial in the eye.

Sergonial smiled and left saying, “We will make one soul's dream come true if she in turn gives her existence to the cause. This is indeed a deal he won't be able to refuse." On the very same day, Sergonial commissioned his most suitable agents to go into the [[Material Plane]] and make anyone's wishes come true, in exchange for him giving them his soul upon his death.

These agreements were called [[Devil Contracts]].

Over a century had passed since the [[Eternal Slaughter]] and the "newborn" [[Hell]] had just begun to stabilize and legitimize its existence in the eyes of anyone, whether they liked it or not and [[Styx]] was permanently connected to it. The [[Devil Contracts]] were, as of then, the only source of souls for [[Hell]]. But Orgonol did not see in him the perfect world that Sergonial commanded. That's when Katharos, the Pit was made in the third layer of [[Hell]]. Many souls did not want to help [[Sergonial]] in what he was doing and there he sent them to torture them. Orgonol could not tolerate this. He went before Sergonial and told him that he cannot torture souls.

"It's not your job to judge me." replied Sergonial.

"Seems to me you're not too different from [[Yerastu]] after all," he said as he left.

Sergonial thought of dismembering him at that moment where he was but he didn't want to destroy one of his strongest soldiers, so he spared his life. This was a mistake he paid dearly. Shortly after this Orgonol went to the Pit and freed all the souls that were there. All Hell was after him, but he did accomplish his mission. When he finally succeeded he took these souls to Yerastu, who hated him more than anyone but recognized that he was the best to judge what would happen to them. Yerastu in return gave him a place in the [[Fortress of the Just]] to serve justice.
