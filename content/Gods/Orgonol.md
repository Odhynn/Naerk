Over a century had passed since the [[Eternal Slaughter]] and the "newborn" [[Hell]] had just begun to stabilize and legitimize its existence in the eyes of anyone, whether they liked it or not and [[Styx]] was permanently connected to it. The [[Scrolls of the Supreme Tyrant|Deals of the Devil]] were, as of then, the only source of souls for [[Hell]]. But Orgonol did not see in him the perfect world that Sergonial commanded. That's when Katharos, the Pit was made in the third layer of [[Hell]]. Many souls did not want to help [[Sergonial]] in what he was doing and there he sent them to torture them. Orgonol could not tolerate this. He went before Sergonial and told him that he cannot torture souls.

"It's not your job to judge me." replied Sergonial.

"Seems to me you're not too different from [[Yerastu]] after all," he said as he left.

Sergonial thought of dismembering him at that moment where he was but he didn't want to destroy one of his strongest soldiers, so he spared his life. This was a mistake he paid dearly. Shortly after this Orgonol went to the Pit and freed all the souls that were there. All Hell was after him, but he did accomplish his mission. When he finally succeeded he took these souls to Yerastu, who hated him more than anyone but recognized that he was the best to judge what would happen to them. Yerastu in return gave him a place in the [[Fortress of the Just]] to serve justice.
