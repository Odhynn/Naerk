This hulking [[Devil]] was captain in [[Sergonial]]'s army during the [[Eternal Slaughter]]. He considered that the battle could be won much more easily if the warriors did not make mistakes: He constantly admonished them to obey his orders and limit the mistakes they made in their tactics. Although his methods were strict but successful, he himself was not satisfied. He believed that no matter how hard he tried, the battle was an endless mess in which even the most disciplined warrior could not function perfectly.

After the end of the Eternal Slaughter, he left the military and became involved in the bureaucratic affairs of [[Hell]]. He built a huge administrative building on Avernus, which he filled with clerks, accountants, lawyers, and handled various technical matters of Hell. He did not tolerate a single mistake: anyone who did, was punished exemplary. In his eyes, mistakes were worse than an attack on him. Wherever he found an imperfection, he would not stop until it was corrected. His obsession with perfection has led even creatures from other dimensions, as well as mortals, ending up coming for his services: Services, however, that are particularly expensive.
