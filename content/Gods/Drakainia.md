A powerful entity of [[Yast]], that tried to enter the [[Material Plane]] near [[Merkal]] with cultist help, eventually causing the [[Vethfall]]. She was summoned by the alchemist [[Vivec]] and he began experimenting on her, charging her with positive energy in a specially constructed demiplane. However this drove her completely crazy and Vivec lost control.
