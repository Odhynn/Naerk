## The Gift of Strength

Otynhash means of domination are exercised in many different ways, but they all boil down to strength as a key part of his sphere of influence. In one instance, he can give a person supernatural strength, and it is said that this is how some of the most ruthless races of giants sprang up. In another case, he can help someone in a duel or battle, making them invincible at a relevant cost. From time to time, he has also collaborated with [[Karadosh]], sending his own demons to aid the [[Warclaw]] or participating in the ceremonies that give strength and animalistic characteristics to his servants.

For Otynhash, the end justifies the means, and in this case the end is the acquisition of power. Even the weakest mortal may come before him and not only will he not reject him, considering him weak, but he will strengthen him like any other. Obviously, he will do the same to anyone else, constantly leading to conflicts and wars. From violence he believes the truly strong will emerge, those who will be his most worthy followers and have earned a place in the [[Abyss]] by their merit. His creation is also the labyrinth of [[Ixion]], a fatal test for his most faithful subjects that elevate them beyond even mortality.

## History

Otynhash hated deeply the methods [[Disiklek]] was using and fought him during the [[Demonic Civil War]]. He established himself after the war as one of the ruling [[Demon Archlords]] in the [[Abyss]].

## [[Pinewoods Slaughter]]

As the extent of the power that Otynhash could offer mortals became imminent, more people appeared to desire it. At first, the lord of the Abyss granted them their wishes: strength, endurance, tough skin, horns, huge jaws, or whatever else they asked of him, and they gradually joined the forces of the [[Abyss]]. And his powers were growing.

But Otynhash soon realized that his demon warriors were growing weaker. He wasn't sure why his warriors gradually didn't have the same strength as the first ones, but he wanted to test them. Thus, in the year 1847, those of his warriors who had not yet passed through the Abyss gathered and [[Pinewoods slaughter|attacked]] [[Tarthyn]]. The elves, humans and druids of the area were caught off guard by the sudden advance of the demonic army. Forests burned, houses were destroyed, and the army seemed unstoppable.

However, Tarthyn's forces soon gathered, and awaited Otynhash's army at Lake Tartha. The demonic army charged straight at Tarthyn's defenses, and received a cloud of arrows, while horsemen and wild bears and badgers surrounded them. Carnage ensued, as those who came to hand-to-hand combat with Otynhash's first demonic minotaurs and beasts fell dead, but their losses were immense. In the end, only a small group was able to break the Tarthyn cordon to the south and escape the slaughter.

## [[Ixion]] Labyrinth

And then the god of power came to a painful conclusion. Of those who had survived the battle, the vast majority belonged to the first generations to whom he had given his gift. Somehow, Otynhash realized that not everyone was worthy of such a blessing. Anyone who wanted his help would first have to prove himself worthy of it. So he set in [[Pinewoods]] a challenge he felt was fitting.

He built a labyrinth at the entrance to one of his temples, which stretched for miles through a muddy and wooded region, and named it Ixion. In there, no magic works at all: Only by conventional means can one face the challenges that lie ahead. And when it comes to challenges, Otynhash gave his worst. In there there are stories of deformed plants, wild animals and beasts, huge demons and minotaurs.

The further one gets in the maze, the bigger the challenge. Anyone who reaches certain altars in the maze gains the gift of Otynhash, a simple blessing usually linked to his choices in the maze, the creatures he fought, and his temperament. He is safe to return: if he chooses to stay still the next altars become even more demanding and the path much more dangerous, but the reward is greater still.

For the vast majority, death lurks around every corner. Many travelers and druids have been lost there unknowingly, never to emerge, and those who emerged were unrecognizable. In the past, [[Raefibb]] had attempted with several Swarm [[Druids]] to destroy the labyrinth, but their efforts met with little success and heavy casualties.

There is a rare category of those who manage to reach the first altars and choose to continue. The vast majority face dangers beyond imagination. There are, however, some rare cases of those who passed the entire labyrinth and reached the end, the final altar. These are the Chosen of Otynhash, and they are less than a dozen. For them the demon god saves his greatest gifts. They often become generals of demonic hordes, warriors of unparalleled strength and endurance. Even the sight of them often strikes terror into many armies.
