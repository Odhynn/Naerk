## The Gift of Strength

Otynhash means of domination are exercised in many different ways, but they all boil down to strength as a key part of his sphere of influence. In one instance, he can give a person supernatural strength, and it is said that this is how some of the most ruthless races of giants sprang up. In another case, he can help someone in a duel or battle, making them invincible at a relevant cost. From time to time, he has also collaborated with [[Karadosh]], sending his own demons to aid the [[Warclaw]] or participating in the ceremonies that give strength and animalistic characteristics to his servants.

For Otynhash, the end justifies the means, and in this case the end is the acquisition of power. Even the weakest mortal may come before him and not only will he not reject him, considering him weak, but he will strengthen him like any other. Obviously, he will do the same to anyone else, constantly leading to conflicts and wars. From violence he believes the truly strong will emerge, those who will be his most worthy followers and have earned a place in the [[Abyss]] by their merit. His creation is also the labyrinth of [[Ixion]], a fatal test for his most faithful subjects that elevate them beyond even mortality.

## History

Otynhash hated deeply the methods [[Disiklek]] was using and fought him during the [[Demonic Civil War]].
