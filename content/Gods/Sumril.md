[[Sumril]] is a [[Primordial]] from the [[Ethereal Plane]] that created [[Utopia]]. She promotes the superiority of the soul and tries to overcome the material world through meditation. She teaches spiritual elevation and absolute peace beyond all material obstacles, leading to mental empowerment and self-perfection. Among her followers are monks, hermits, guards, martial artists, disciplined warriors, scholars and spellcasters.

After the events of [[Astral Alignment]], [[Yerastu]] proposed her to join a pantheon with the imprisoned [[Maeronian]] to guard the secrets of magic. She accepted reluctantly, and since then she is at a constant opposition with the [[Vethians|Vethian]] to maintain a balance to the arcane world and the spells used on the [[Material Plane]].
