## A Tale of Hate: Karadosh

[[Karadosh]]'s destructive rage quickly had many consequences. Towns and villages were being deserted and waves of refugees were running to find shelter away from death and carnage. And among those who ran to escape, there was one who decided to fight. He was a hunter whose name has been lost to the ages, a mythical creature with a reputation as a tireless predator. His skill with the bow and spear was unique and he had three dogs, each the size of a bear.

The two clashed in the forest now called [[Tanfolia]]. They began to chase each other through the thick trees and bushes, in a contest which lasted two months, for both had inexhaustible patience and fortitude. Karadosh was able to kill two of the hunter's three dogs, while both were injured. Finally, the hunter set a trap with a dying deer, which Karadosh, hungry, could not resist. As he approached his prey, the hunter wounded him with two arrows and then gouged out his eye with his spear. But these were not enough to stop Karadosh's rage. He pushed past the last hound and charged at the hunter. He had his teeth in his leg and now he was sure of his victory.

But, unfortunately for him, the two were not alone. For Valanshore, the run of the stag, had had his fill of Karadosh's toys, and had lost many animals and elves to his clutches. The wounded deer was actually a loyal servant, who had allied herself with the hunter. And just like that, a pair of horns flung Karadosh over, and the hunter climbed onto the deer and was saved.

The hunter became known as the Huntsman. He never fully recovered from the leg wound, and around his neck he wears the claws from his two dead hounds. The deer, a megaloceros, became his permanent consort, and he vowed that he would not stop unless he killed Karadosh. For many years he pursued him, not knowing that the other had withdrawn: At last the fury of his revenge gathered many who gave strength to his cause and made the legend around his person legendary.

The Huntsman is still looking for Karadosh, and one would say the feelings are mutual, since the god of carnage himself still has the scar in his eye. The Huntsman took the moniker of vengeance, and is worshiped among many elves, centaurs, hunters, and other creatures of the forest. Among the acts, it is considered the most decisive and among the most stubborn. His cult became particularly strong in areas plagued by raiding gnolls, [[Warclaw]]s and werewolves. And he, in turn, rewards those who follow his difficult path.
