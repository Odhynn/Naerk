Gibba, the Elemental Lady of Earth, always kept a low profile in the titanic battles of the Primordial War. By nature she preferred firmness and decisive action, while making every effort to secure when its result was certain. Hers was an essential influence on the formation of most of [[Na'erk]] and everything on the [[Material Plane|Material World]]. However, the rest of the [[Primodials|primordial lords]] did not share her peaceful views.

## KELZADAM

The Elemental Lord of Fire, [[Fyrlean]], had underestimated her, and decided in his arrogance to attack her, seeing her as an easy target. The fight that followed was fierce, because Gibba was really angry that he didn't respect her peace. At a time when the world was still unstable and many primordial beings threatened it, she felt that they should be united against the common enemy. In this battle, rumor has it that no one could win, because the two were equal. As a result of this battle, [[Kelzadam was formed.]]

## TARTARA

In another instance, she was forced to intervene in order to contain the dangerous beings of Tartara. She formed there a huge stone prison that engulfed the plane and compressed everything inside, limiting [[Saekla]]'s creation and imprisoning the creatures in it. This enraged Saekla even more against her, although her intervention was necessary to maintain the order.

## ATTOR AND THE FIRST GIANTS

When [[Attor]], the first giant, asked for her help to give power to his art, she responded, and the first giants emerged. However, the other [[Elemental Lords]] didn't respond well to her sudden increase of influence and chaos broke out in the [[Elemental Ring]]. This ended when Attor secretly gave power and giant followers to the other Lords too, however this was believed to be a treachery by all four of them and they split his soul in four pieces upon his death, each claiming one and condemned him to eternal torture.
