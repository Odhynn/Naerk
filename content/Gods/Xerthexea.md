Amongst the most powerful [[Vulga]] was Xerthexea. Rumor has it that she was born in war, and that could not be more truth. She grew up alone in the caves in the lower levels in [[Tartara]], where she had been left to die. Coming out, she faced one of the greatest battles in history: the [[Eternal Slaughter]]. Xerthexea survived as a warrior. Whoever came to kill her, she killed. Anyone who had something that would help her in battle, she killed him and took it from him. And this went on for many years, until Xerthexea had no room in her shelter to carve out how many she had killed or to keep her trophies.

The Vulga soon realized her strength in battle when she decided to leave her shelter and wander. She was found by the Vulga leaders and was offered to fight with them as the Eternal Slaughter ended, and they would reward her in any way she wished. Xerthexea then led them to her lair and demanded that they pay her a diamond for every scratch she made on the wall. And the Vulga, it is said, were able to raise this sum, albeit with great difficulty. So Xerthexea joined them in their perpetual battle for destruction and assaulted the [[Material Plane]] in [[The Eruption]]: and it was her own hand that slew Archangel [[Li-Tithlamir]].
