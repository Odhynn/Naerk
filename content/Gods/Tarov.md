In many parts of the north Tarov is mistaken for [[Gibba]], the Elemental Lady of Earth. This is no coincidence, as both have reference to the power of stone and earth, while Tarov does not appear as often as the rest of the [[Aspects]], and when she does, she takes the form of hedgehogs, mice, and ants, and rarely draws much attention. At other times she takes the form of a land turtle, which she is best known for, but again most often mistake her for a stone, as she rarely intervenes in situations and prefers to watch for long periods of time before acting.

Tarov first appeared when [[Volrek]] suddenly began to grow giant. The ancient tree of the Evergrowing Forest grew at a rapid rate, and at one point it was said that its roots penetrated deep into the ground. The tree to sustain itself had underground surpassed the spectral boundaries of the [[Evergrowing Forest]] and its roots passed into the [[Elemental Ring]]. But this piece acquired a consciousness and intelligence of its own as it progressed deep into the earth and stone.

Tarov's roots continued to swell, and her presence was long hidden from most. He dug deep, became one with the soil, and soon occupied an entire chunk in the Ring. This power of hers could not leave the [[Material Plane]] intact, as her essence soon contained stone and rocks. In the material plane, it appears as faint yellow lines at specific points, also known as [[Leylines]]. These are essentially veins that pass through rock and solid mineral formations and form a vast underground network, which is mainly found in certain places in the Deeps.

Those in her favor, or those of the other gods who work and respect the earth, can deeply perceive the [[Leylines]] and draw strength from this network. Among them are builders who want to increase the durability and statics of their structures, mainly dwarves and humans; some are priests who want to carve runes into the ground, or shamans and druids who make menir for protection and strength; some are craftsmen and creators of stone and metal objects, who find their abilities and products strengthened in these points; and some few are climbers on the mountain tops, who find through these points the strength to continue their course.

Even the magical runes themselves have their origins in Tarov. The magic circles of protection in the ground, the letters for good luck on the corners of buildings, the carved runes on weapons and armor, the ceremonies in the smithies and the explosive traps carved into the ground are all based on the fact that these letters, where they are carved, can act as a conduit to channel [[Veth]]'s magical energy and radiation. This also explains how magic continues to exist, albeit limited, deep underground, and in various unexplored and isolated parts of the world.

Often the creatures in the depths of the [[Deeps]], peaceful and otherwise, literally feed off the power of these veins. They often stay in the same spot and sometimes migrating from node to node. It is suspected by many that even massive creatures such as [[Klivichkie]] used Leylines to feed and grow stronger. On the other hand, it is possible that the existence of such hosts is also the factor that limits the reckless growth of veins.

As for [[Gibba]], Tarov's action gave a new meaning to her existence, and thus she embraced her existence and her interventions. After the [[Ghost War]], where Tarov stayed in the [[Material Plane]] for a long time, she found her influence strengthened, and her veins are now found in almost every mountain range and every major cave complex and most of the [[Deeps]]. However, most of the time, travelers pass by these places and do not even realize the existence of the veins.
