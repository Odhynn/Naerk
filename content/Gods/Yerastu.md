## Creation

Once [[Styx|Orovos]], the creature of [[Amehan]], was defeated, souls could safely traverse the river. However, in order to complete [[Malahir]]'s agreement with the gods, an entity had to be created, that would decide which plane each soul goes to on afterlife. Thus, the gods gathered all their forces, and from this union was created Yerastu, who took the nickname "the Observer". Thats because he could understand the past, actions and motives of every soul that appeared before him and make appropriate judgement on their demise.

## Tailway

With the power he had been given, and with Malahir's help, he built a plane that communicated with the Ethereal plane, and created many otherworldly servants, who would help him in the difficult process of collecting, protecting and transporting souls. This plane was named the [[Tailway]], the final route, and his servants the [[Kenemi]], the Conveyors. Finally, Yerasthu was given the task of keeping Orovos in a coma, for if it did wake up, there was no guarantee that it would be as easy to put back to sleep, let alone as the souls passing through him grew in number over time.

## Kenemi

However, as time went on, problems started to appear. Initially, some souls had no plane to go to that matched their actions, or were not accepted by the patrons of that plane, so they turned back. The Observer, over time, defined a specific framework of values, from his experience, and began to accept souls who agreed with it, as well as those who were stranded there.

According to the Observer, there is no act a mere mortal can do that would disqualify him for service as a Kenemi, except for those who had great power and used it to destabilize the universe and Orovos. Yerasthu among his duties set the protection and safety of dimensions and routes. Owed to Malahir, he simultaneously took over the protection of the circle of life, punishing anyone who defied his death and the workings of space-time, and soon found Voolthow among his enemies.

## Demons Mutiny

His servants though, the Kenemi, began to multiply over time, and although at first the Observer held them under iron discipline, slowly several of them began to develop different opinions and approaches for the souls' final destination. The most organized group of them were from those who had taken it upon themselves to take souls to the other planes.

Those souls who were not accepted into the dimensions they were going to were the first target of this group, which later became known as [[demons]]. Their power was strengthened by souls who felt too miserable to serve eternally, by those who experienced rejection and emptiness, and by those who were convinced overtime to follow them. They went to great lengths to go undetected by Yerasthu, who was otherwise tasked with controlling them as well. Then, they agreed to escape, and while seemingly transporting souls to other planes, they gathered at the farthest point of the Styx river, and there they made their kingdom: the [[Abyss]].

When Yerastu realized the treachery of the demons, he was overcome with rage. He punished everyone in his service that he believed to be even slightly complicit or disobedient. His next move was to regroup all the Kenemi, his servants. He established a very tight and strict framework of rules, and imposed penalties on anyone who did not follow them to the letter. Very soon, there was no doubt that everyone under his authority was completely devoted and loyal.

## The [[Eternal Slaughter]]

After taking care of the safety of souls and the planar routes, he ordered the leader of the Kenemi, [[Sergonial]], to attack the demons. Based in the Abyss, they constantly organized raids on Styx, where they stole the souls they found defenseless. The demons were determined and focused their power on their goals: They wanted to take revenge on the Observer and destroy the circle of life.

Sergonial's army met the demon hordes at Tartara and started one of the biggest wars ever fought. Demons and Kenemi clashed for untold centuries upon the sundered fields. Yerastu decided eventually that this war led to no end and called Sergonial to retreat and return back. His messenger was slain and Sergonial defied his will, taking his armies with him and forming [[Hell]] and [[devils]].

## [[Day of Wild Magic]]

Yerastu appeared at the end of the events that happened in the [[Day of Wild Magic]] as it has befallen to his attention of the extreme magic abuse that took place. However, he acted only after [[Voolthow]] decided to appear on the [[Material Plane]]. He appeared in front of him as an anthropomorphic creature in white and blue robes, twenty foot tall, with a pair of massive wings emerging from its back, created from raw energy. Wonder was painted in Sylris's eyes as, to him, the most absurd thing about Yerastu's invasion was not his descent into the material plane, nor the massive beams of light that surrounded him, but the lack of a face beneath his imposing hood. Accompanying his terrifying presence was a massive execution sword that seemed made not for the needs of a battle but for the dismemberment of souls crossing the Ethereal Plane.

All the momentum Voolthow had gained was suddenly lost. Yerastu took the floor and addressed the Shadow god in a stern tone. _"Who gave you the right to intervene? You have seconds until you finish your dialogue with these mortals and return to your plane."_
Voolthow made a sudden move absorbing a large amount of Vaelasil's magical energy and threw the orb to Sylris' side: _â€œThis orb will remain in the possession of mortals as its power flourishes, corrupting its master's soul. The orb belongs to you. Manage it as you will"_ as he fled for the [[Shadow Plane|Shadow Realm]] with a loud chuckle.
Yerastu informed the dragon and Sylris that he would close the rift himself and that in their next meeting he would not be so kind, in a serious yet stern tone. Before heading off to seal the rift he replied to himself with critical speech: _"Malahir was wrong, elves were not to be given immortality and your actions showed it. Your period of grace is over!"_

In less than a moment the rift had been sealed and Yerastu had disappeared from their sight. Sylris could see the appearance of a new translucent veil beneath the existing one. The day of Wild Magic had ended.

## [[Astral Alignment]]

Yerastu was forced to intervene when [[Maeronian]] harnessed mass amounts of arcane power to his followers during a unique [[Astral Alignment]]. He imprisoned him to maintain the safety of time and space but after realising this wouldn't solve the problem he decided to make a proposal to the Vethian captive. If he chose to share his magical powers with [[Sumril]], he would free him and allow him to join the pantheon, oblivious to being a Vethian and his past transgressions. But he made it an additional condition that the use of this kind of magic would be severely curtailed, and that together with Sumril they would have to curtail abusers, starting with Xe'Farom.

Maeronian accepted, and together with Sumril they are responsible for managing and controlling all magic, its users and Veth's radiation, as well as any unforeseen events. As a condition of agreeing, Maeronian stipulated that Yerasthu would not punish Xe'Farom and its inhabitants if they limited their magical effects to the original data, and so it was. Since then, Sumril was able to very effectively control whenever any abuse was made and curtail it, while Xe'Farom significantly limited her use of magic, and both gods placed an invisibility cloak around the city and Na 'erk, which filters what properties emitted magic can provide, limiting magic that affects spacetime.
