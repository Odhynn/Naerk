## Creation

Once [[Styx|Orovos]], the creature of [[Amehan]], was defeated, souls could safely traverse the river. However, in order to complete [[Malahir]]'s agreement with the gods, an entity had to be created, that would decide which plane each soul goes to on afterlife. Thus, the gods gathered all their forces, and from this union was created Yerastu, who took the nickname "the Observer". Thats because he could understand the past, actions and motives of every soul that appeared before him and make appropriate judgement on their demise.

## Tailway

With the power he had been given, and with Malahir's help, he built a plane that communicated with the Ethereal plane, and created many otherworldly servants, who would help him in the difficult process of collecting, protecting and transporting souls. This plane was named the [[Tailway]], the final route, and his servants the [[Kenemi]], the Conveyors. Finally, Yerasthu was given the task of keeping Orovos in a coma, for if it did wake up, there was no guarantee that it would be as easy to put back to sleep, let alone as the souls passing through him grew in number over time.

## Kenemi

However, as time went on, problems started to appear. Initially, some souls had no plane to go to that matched their actions, or were not accepted by the patrons of that plane, so they turned back. The Observer, over time, defined a specific framework of values, from his experience, and began to accept souls who agreed with it, as well as those who were stranded there.

According to the Observer, there is no act a mere mortal can do that would disqualify him for service as a Kenemi, except for those who had great power and used it to destabilize the universe and Orovos. Yerasthu among his duties set the protection and safety of dimensions and routes. Owed to Malahir, he simultaneously took over the protection of the circle of life, punishing anyone who defied his death and the workings of space-time, and soon found Voolthow among his enemies.

## Demons Mutiny

His servants though, the Kenemi, began to multiply over time, and although at first the Observer held them under iron discipline, slowly several of them began to develop different opinions and approaches for the souls' final destination. The most organized group of them were from those who had taken it upon themselves to take souls to the other planes.

Those souls who were not accepted into the dimensions they were going to were the first target of this group, which later became known as [[demons]]. Their power was strengthened by souls who felt too miserable to serve eternally, by those who experienced rejection and emptiness, and by those who were convinced overtime to follow them. They went to great lengths to go undetected by Yerasthu, who was otherwise tasked with controlling them as well. Then, they agreed to escape, and while seemingly transporting souls to other planes, they gathered at the farthest point of the Styx river, and there they made their kingdom: the [[Abyss]].
