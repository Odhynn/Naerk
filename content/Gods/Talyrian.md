## Description

The Queen of the winged messengers, she is especially beloved among the elves. Talyrian first appeared in [[Ghost War]], and has since traveled between the Evergrowing Forest, [[Zaramel]], and the [[Material Plane]]. She has at her service a large number of fairies, birds, animals and insects that serve her. You will rarely find her standing still: she is constantly traveling through snowy mountains, flowery plains or singing in the steppes. She is worshiped by various creatures from the [[Evergrowing Forest]], and has a large dividend on the cape of [[Kelonarie]], where she had built the capital of [[Verhalith]] and sat for the longest time, almost two centuries. Centaurs and satyrs often sing in her name, and she has devotees even among sphinxes and harpies.

She is believed to be the grandmother of the elven hero [[Alazir]] Silverflame.

## Doctrine

Her doctrine includes that all messages and their messengers must be respected, while travelers must be able to accommodate and care for each other.

## History

When Talyrian first found herself in the [[Material Plane]], it was in the ruins of the [[Ghost War]]. She wandered west, trying to rebuild nature and heal the damage, but she soon realized that she did not know [[Naerk]] well enough. She herself may have thought she was helping, but her criteria was the outer dimensions of the [[Evergrowing Forest]] and [[Zaramel]]. She was not used to the death and decay that were so common here. She found that no matter what she created, its beauty was soon lost, whether it was years or centuries afterwards. She felt that her efforts were futile, but she did not want to turn back, as she still had much to offer.

## Verhalith and her Love

Her travels led her to the [[Kelonarie]] Peninsula. There she found fertile ground, as most of the [[Evergrowing Forest]] creatures who had come from the [[Ghost War]] had retreated here. Here, she found friends who knew and could maintain what she made, and she felt she could leave a legacy behind her. House by house, tree by tree, the Winged Messenger walked, leaving behind her paths of flowers and butterflies and birds that built nests in her path. The trees blossomed and blossomed, while anyone she touched forgot their suffering. All the creatures of the forest were captivated and charmed by her presence.

In the heart of the forest, the fairies began to expand a beautiful city, Verhalith. It had blue and green buildings, made of woven wood, moss, and rocks that shimmered with all shades of green. Satyrs, gnomes, and centaurs came and settled, and the music of the city echoed throughout the forest, inviting creatures to join in the growing spirit of euphoria. And in Talyrianâ€™s presence, the music grew louder and the colors more vivid. [[Portals]] appeared in the city, and messengers and visitors from every conceivable place teleported in. And there Talyrian met her first love, in the face of a beautiful fairy, [[Queen Vellanie]], who played music and sang in the forest. They fell in love and ruled the city together, and by this time even pilgrims and elves from Edhelwood and the ends of the world came to see the wonder of this city and their presence.

## Grief

But the time came, after two centuries, when Talyrian had to leave. Her duties were in the [[Evergrowing Forest]] and in many other places: She could not stand still and was content with her work in [[Kelonarie]]. She had to obey [[Malahir]]'s cause, that life moves on. However, her absence was felt from the first day. Vellanie resigned her leadership, heartbroken, and disappeared into the forests. The music became distant, the colors dull, and the breezes sad. The birds did not chirp and no flowers bloomed on the trees. The magical Gates of the city were closed for good. The branches on the trees leaned down, and the leaves fell. Even the plants seemed to cry in her absence, and a mist covered the forest, said to be from the tears of its creatures. And the forest has since become known as the [[Forest of Tears]].

Many attempts have been made since then to bring Talyrian back, but no one has been able to find the Winged Messenger. She herself wanted to return, but she knew that she would not be able to see the beauty of Verhalith again for a while and then leave again, while she knew that she had made [[Queen Vellanie]] unhappy: And out of shame, she avoided her. The dull colors and distant music have become a habit in Kellonarie, which is home to all sorts of outcasts, but seems unable to return to its former beauty.

Queen Vellanie's intense grief had left the palace dark and silent. At its peak, stood a sentient tree, Azureleaf, that had been her longtime friend and was directly influenced by her. Gradually, all of its leaves fell off, and its roots and branches wrapped around the palace to deter visitors. At the same time, a cunning creature arrived at the palace, [[Maldithrin]], a one-eyed, bat-winged beast who changed shapes and managed to trick the queen into becoming her advisor. As time passed, he managed to sideline all of her close servants and advisors and had them banished, imprisoned, or summarily executed.

Maldithrin fed on the queen's frustration, and remained in the palace like a parasite. Gradually, as Azureleaf strengthened the palace walls, it became completely cut off from the outside world, and acquired its own microclimate: Static, endless, and full of negative emotions. Inside the palace, time seemed to have stopped, the queen lost track of the days, and Maldithrin practically took over the entire administration of the kingdom. He made sure that no one bothered her and limited her appearances to a minimum. He brought his own guard, various exiles and criminals of the [[Evergrowing Forest]], as well as undead guards and spirits.

The very existence of the palace was tied to Azureleaf, and he in turn believed that Maldithrin was the queen's friend, and protected her: but he used her tears to water the tree and gradually Azureleaf began to acquire Maldithrin's perspective, as time passed. The decades became centuries and the centuries became millennia, and the queen remained in his control, while the tree had now become his ally and sought victims to feed on their negative emotions. Those who challenged Maldithrin and his authority ended up in prison, and the most audacious were tortured or executed, or worse, turned into deformed beasts, slaves to his whims.

## Closing Wounds

In the year 4727, a wizard traveling through the city saw a painting of the queen on a canvas and was fascinated. With a divination spell he was able to see her, locked and desperate in the tower, and fell in love with her. He decided to send her a letter expressing his feelings in the form of a poem, but it never reached her, as Maldithrin controlled all the documents that reached her. So, he found three local adventurers, a catfolk and two fairies to deliver the letter, emphasizing that it was strictly for her. [[Talyrian]] gradually gained an interest in the messengers and began to watch closely, but she could not interfere. She was their protector and the message had to arrive, but she could not enter the palace.

The three messengers secretly entered the palace through the sewers, through a route that an former escapee had found. They fought Maldithrin's guards and the palace defenses to ascend to the higher levels. They freed the prisoners, and after hide-and-seek, fighting, and chasing, they reached the queen's chambers where Maldithrin attacked them, determined to prevent them from delivering the letter at all costs. They severely wounded him with the help of a palace guard and drove him off. He sought refuge at the top of the palace, where Azureleaf had taken root.

Thus, the letter reached the queen, and she, reading it, emerged from the oblivion she had been in for so long. Slowly, the palace defenses receded and time began to flow normally. The queen gradually realized what had happened, but she needed time. The messengers reached the top, where they fought the corrupted Azureleaf, and killed Maldithrin that had taken refuge in its branches. After a fierce battle, the tree, scorched and cut down, wrapped, choked and killed the messengers with its roots, sucking the life out of them. However, they managed to purify it, cutting off the branches that Maldithrin had poisoned, and together with the queen, it gradually found its old lost self.

The queen gradually restored her power over Verhalith and the forest, but the wounds of the past would take a long time to heal. New flowers timidly emerged in the forest, and the satyrs for the first time began their first cheerful music. Life seemed to be returning to Kelonarie, after a slumber of millennia. As for the messengers, their souls reached the Evergrowing Forest and Talyrian, to make amends for her own mistakes, made them her servants, animal-like otherworldly creatures who patrol over the planes and further her goals: However, they soon realized that they had the freedom to act in any way they wished.
