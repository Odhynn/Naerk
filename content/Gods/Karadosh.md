## The Savage Tale

By the time [[Na'erk]] had been created and the first intelligent beings had begun to wander and build civilizations, [[Amehan]] had fallen into contemplation. Sure, he couldn't be troubled like any living being, but he wasn't happy with the plot of things. [[Malahir|Life]] had taken over the planet, and in many instances, sentient beings formed alliances with each other, exchanged gifts, and lived peacefully. Ever since they had stopped living like wild savages struggling for survival, their population had skyrocketed. In his point of view, the population had to be reduced somehow, and quickly or there would be a disaster. But he could not intervene directly in the world, to destroy everything and fulfill his role.

He searched for quite some time, until he found the solution to his problem. In a cave, he found a wild man, a savage, who was sharpening a stone knife in the fire. Unable to appear before him himself, he sent his scent to a nearby panther, a primal canine, who sniffed her to the entrance of the cave. There he stopped and roared. The savage attacked the animal, and the two hunters clashed with each other.

The battle lasted for a long time. The hunter initially, armed with his knife, tried to keep the animal at a distance. It clawed at him, and ran around him almost unscathed. After a while, with a lucky stroke, the hunter drove the knife into the animal's side as it slashed through his chest. His knife broke, and the animal, smelling the blood, sprang upon him. It began to tear at him, closed its teeth around his shoulder, its hind legs scraping against his leather clothing and the belly underneath. Then the hunter reacted in a completely unpredictable way. His eyes reddened with rage, he wrapped his arms around the animal's neck and threw it down with all his might, a move that tore his own flesh away in several places, which the animal's teeth and claws took apart.

He then jumped on the animal and bit it in the neck while punching it in the chest. Amehan, who had been watching the battle spellbound, decided to intervene. He considered that both were worthy fighters and could only help in his plans. So he struck the ground with a bolt of lightning, and the two injured opponents were flung away, and looked at each other in mutual admiration.

With the panther at his side, Karadosh descended the hills and gathered other wildlings, as none after this mighty battle had any intention of challenging him. Then he headed for the civilized regions, armed from head to toe. Thus began a cycle of suburban and urban battles, in which Karadosh slaughtered with an unstoppable fury anyone who stood in the way of his conquests. In various battles, he even took a hybrid form, half human and half beast, and rumors say that no weapon could hurt him, while his strength and speed were unmatched.

But Karadosh had no intention of ruling or subjugating anyone. He left no one in his inner circle, and everyone learned to fear and avoid him. Until one day, after a bloodbath in a human capital, Karadosh decided to return to his cave. Nevertheless, those who dared to look for him there never found him.

For Karadosh was now a demigod, a tool in the hands of Amehan, and those who followed him had received the gift of animal transformation. And the fledgling civilizations of the temperate regions soon learned to fear his loyal warriors and beasts, gnolls and untamable skinwalkers, also known as the [[Warclaw]].

## Huntsman, Enmity of Hate

Karadosh's destructive rage quickly had many consequences. Towns and villages were being deserted and waves of refugees were running to find shelter away from death and carnage. And among those who ran to escape, there was one who decided to fight. He was a hunter whose name has been lost to the ages, a mythical creature with a reputation as a tireless predator. His skill with the bow and spear was unique and he had three dogs, each the size of a bear.

The two clashed in the forest now called [[Tanfolia]]. They began to chase each other through the thick trees and bushes, in a contest which lasted two months, for both had inexhaustible patience and fortitude. Karadosh was able to kill two of the hunter's three dogs, while both were injured. Finally, the hunter set a trap with a dying deer, which Karadosh, hungry, could not resist. As he approached his prey, the hunter wounded him with two arrows and then gouged out his eye with his spear. But these were not enough to stop Karadosh's rage. He pushed past the last hound and charged at the hunter. He had his teeth in his leg and now he was sure of his victory.

But, unfortunately for him, the two were not alone. For Valanshore, the run of the stag, had had his fill of Karadosh's toys, and had lost many animals and elves to his clutches. The wounded deer was actually a loyal servant, who had allied herself with the hunter. And just like that, a pair of horns flung Karadosh over, and the hunter climbed onto the deer and was saved.

The hunter became known as the Huntsman. He never fully recovered from the leg wound, and around his neck he wears the claws from his two dead hounds. The deer, a megaloceros, became his permanent consort, and he vowed that he would not stop unless he killed Karadosh. For many years he pursued him, not knowing that the other had withdrawn: At last the fury of his revenge gathered many who gave strength to his cause and made the legend around his person legendary.

The Huntsman is still looking for Karadosh, and one would say the feelings are mutual, since the god of carnage himself still has the scar in his eye.
