## The Eternal Slaughter

The leader of the Kenemi, Sergonial, was ordered by [[Yerastu]] to attack the [[demons]] after their mutiny. 

Traveling up the river [[Styx]], Sergonial's army found that there was no easy way to invade the Abyss. Demons guarded all entrances. Then he found that there was a union of the Abyss with the Tartars: A passage through which all his army could fit. The Tartar patrons chose not to mingle, and the Kenemi made their way down that passageway, only to find the entire demon army waiting for them.

What followed was one of the bloodiest skirmishes ever to occur. The battle was fierce, for the hatred of both armies was immense. The Kenemi believed that with this battle they could correct all the mistakes their ex-kin had made, restore the safety of souls, their authority over the planes and be acquitted in Yerasthu's eyes. On the other side, the demons now saw the Kenemi as the greatest obstacle to their ultimate domination of the Styx, their plans to free souls and take them with them and the destruction of the circle of life. The battle continued, for both sides were being reinforced with the troops of countless souls, either stolen by the demons from the Styx or sent by Yerastu to reinforce Sergonial.

The already sundered rocks in Tartarus were filled with the blood of the dead. The place became more and more dilapidated with time. The bodies of the dead, by the hundreds, became one with the surroundings of the place, and soon the battle was being fought over the corpses of the dead. The blood, they say, even now falls like rain, and stains the lower levels red. Eventually the Styx was dyed red, and hideous creatures and corpses began to infest it. The demons found themselves enjoying the slaughter, despite their own losses, for they cared little for the lives of those around them.

The Kenemi eventually found themselves in a difficult position and since they could not win quickly and definitively, they fell into a huge contradiction. On one hand, they were defending the circle of life and souls, on the other hand they were embroiled in a compulsive battle with no end with huge casualties of the souls they were supposedly protecting, even if they were hostile. At the same time, Sergonial promptly punished desertion, and held the entire army in iron discipline, causing the Kenemi to suffocate under his command.

## The Speech of Defiance

Sergonial himself noticed this problem. The battle in Tartarus had eroded them all, and changed them. Then, he decided to change his approach, with an idea playing in his mind. However, even Yerastu decided that he could not defeat the Kenemi once and for all, and to avoid suffering terrible losses, he decided to give up and sent a messenger to order Sergonial to retreat.

At that moment, Sergonial was leading a particularly victorious attack, and he was covered in the blood of his enemies. A mountain of demon corpses was pilled around him, and their armies ran in fear. When Yerasthu's messenger brought the news to the general, his eyes flashed with rage.

_"Weak and fearful, like our enemies! And at the very moment of our final victory, he denies me the reinforcements I so desperately needed!"_

_"You always want more reinforcements! Nothing has changed!"_ He answered. _"Gather the army and come back!"_

His head fell to the ground, severed by a blow from Sergonial's halberd. His army turned and looked at him, in that hour of victory. And so blind was their devotion, that not one asked why he did it, but bowed before his fist. And he called out and his voice echoed across the shattered landscape.

_"My warriors, listen! So many years we fight, and at the moment of our victory, after so many sacrifices, Yerastu abandons us and tells us to go! But after so many battles together, after so much effort to maintain order do you think that we does he deserve such treatment? Do you think we are his slaves, to do his bidding?"_

_"No!"_ A cry was heard from thousands of mouths.

_"We are his equals, and have proved it a thousand times! So here I am, and I defy him! And I will not sit with folded hands and bewail my fate, nor be the minion of a coward who leads from behind and fears her loss! Why, if this war has taught us anything, it's that you have to bleed to win!"_

Screams of approval were heard from everywhere, a thunderous voice.

_""We will make our own world, a Just one, as it should be! We will make it with the experience we have gained, we will regroup and we will become more numerous. And then, neither God nor Demon will be able to treat us as inferiors!"_

## Formation of Hell and Devils

Seeing the coming disaster, the Vulga decided to take action. For the one and only time, they gave the earth the right to interfere in their dimension, and then a huge landslide was created, which completely destroyed the entire plane, and fell on the battlefield. But Sergonial, seeing the impending doom, drew power from the countless dead souls that were around, and created a dimensional rift, separating this shard from the rest of the Tartarus.

And this is how Hell was first created, which gradually expanded. Sergonial, the general, became her tyrant. He maintained military discipline to the utmost and defined a clear hierarchy among his subjects. To grow his army, he made deals with creatures of the material dimension, mortals, helping them in exchange for their souls when they die. And many mortals who longed for power fell into his trap. More and more souls began to be infected by his influence, and Sergonial took those souls from the Observer in death. Sergonial defined mercy as weakness and kindness as a double-edged sword, and found himself confronted by those who upheld these values. Soon, in the [[Material Plane]] entire armies of humans and orcs began to serve him, enslave and kill in his name, while his most loyal warlords and servants took the scrolls with his laws, the so-called [[Scrolls of the Supreme Tyrant]], by whose help they organized their armies and increased their influence.

And the ex-Kenemi in his service, took another name, by which they are now known: [[Devils]].
