As [[Veiroch]] officially assumed his duties as [[Sergonial]]'s tormentor, he soon found that he had to perfect his punishments so that all fiends would fear them and be unwilling to suffer them. So, he used guinea pigs, who were the ones who had repeatedly violated Sergonial's law.

One of them was Captain Molhur. Particularly selfish, he was particularly disobedient on several consecutive occasions. Even Sergonial himself believed that there was not enough time or method of torture to make Molhur trustworthy and obedient again. He therefore gave him to Veiroch to do as he pleased with him. The tortures that Veiroch had in store for him were unrepeatable. She put him through many different machines, tried to play with his soul, took him to the worst parts of [[Hell]], and did all this in public, to serve as an example to avoid.

Molhur soon gave up all hope that his torment might end, and quickly began to take it for granted. This was something Veiroch couldn't understand. Every torture that was inflicted upon Molhur, he began to get used to, which forced the torturer to constantly try new methods, but this backfired: the more the pain, the more Molhur began to like it, up to a level of pleasure. And then Veiroch stopped exposing Molhur publicly, since the punishment was not having the effect he wanted.

This masochistic relationship between the two was doomed to last forever: But one day, his cell was visited by Lord [[Hylosh]] from Utopia: A creature of the [[Asura]] race, one of the strongest of its kind, who maintained good relations with Sergonial. He was stunned by Molhur's stubbornness and behavior, and said the following:

_"I don't know anyone who could take so much pain and suffering and still after so many centuries endure. If you can be so dignified in your condition, I can't even imagine what you would do without those chains."_

And it seems that Asura's words touched a side of younger Molhur that he himself had forgotten after so much hardship. When he tried to free his hands from the chains, the pain was laughable compared to what he had suffered. Same with his legs. And what's more, once he was freed, the pain from the arrows and fire being thrown at him was just as insignificant. He was able to escape and fled to [[Tartara]].

Soon, many imprisoned, tortured and dying followed his example. Even more were those from [[Material Plane]] who followed his doctrine of pain clearing the mind and redeeming the soul through torture, as well as finding purpose through this process.
