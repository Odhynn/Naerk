## History

As the [[Primordial War]] grew in size, the [[Elemental Lords]] found out the hard way that they would be facing many powerful opponents. One of the most powerful was a primordial who would later become known as Neverborn. Neverborn was particularly adept at manipulating the energy around them to heal and create matter. But the problem was that this domain had been officially taken over by [[Nahema]], and the [[Equalizer]] after [[Veth]]'s intervention had made it clear that no such intervention by someone replacing Nahema or [[Amehan]] would be tolerated.

So Nahema, realizing that Neverborn would pose a threat even to her, fought him, even allying with Amehan. After a battle of epic proportions, where she was rumored to have had help from the Elemental Lords as well, she found that her efforts were in vain. Neverborn could manage his power in such a way that every wound he received was instantly healed. Accordingly, gradually Nahema was able to understand the way she did it, with the result that she too was soon able to heal accordingly. The battle seemed to drag on forever.

The war was drawing to a close, and yet the Neverborn was there and there was no getting him out of the way. Then [[Yushan]] intervened, who for some unknown reason wanted the battle to end. The most likely explanation is that he wanted his help to create the [[Zinctizuctra|Scream Fields]]. In any case, after Yushan got what he wanted, he spoke to Amehan and told him that as the cosmogony and planes began, the only way to get rid of Neverborn permanently was to imprison him in the [[Destruction]] plane, the part of the ultimate ruination, which was the kingdom of Amehan.

The Elemental Lords along with Amehan and Nahema were able to kill him there, with several tries. But Neverborn didn't really die. His strength was so great, that his wounds were restored again. However, the negative energy dimension itself constantly attacks him, resulting in him not being able to regain all of his powers. He focused his efforts on staying alive when he normally shouldn't even exist, resulting in him being permanently between life and death.

Neverborn's existence is bound up with pain. He himself is constantly being injured and treated, as a result of which he is permanently in a state of unbearable pain and suffering, which led him to madness. He contacted both [[Yast]] and [[Voolthow]], and allied himself on various occasions with them. He will take advantage of all the means at his disposal in order to achieve his goal: to put an end to his suffering. He knows fully well that the only way for this to happen is to put an end to [[Nahema]] and [[Amehan]], the forces of creation and destruction, and take revenge on those who brought him to this state under the guise of "creation" by stealing his powers.

In the [[Material Plane]] he has few allies. Some undead, primordial creatures that operate independently of Voolthow because they existed before him, some ancient imprints of victories of some primordials, creatures of great power that dwell in the farthest and deepest parts of the world. Among mortals, it resonates with prophets, madmen, paranoids, fanatical dogmas, warriors, those who search the limits of life and death, and various mysterious creatures in the Harrowlands.
