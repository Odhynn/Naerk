## The Digilent Beaver

In the old days, the North was a wild place, hard for survival. He who fought best was the one who survived. Many weak tribes had been displaced and massacres of entire villages and populations were very common. Populations had become nomads, so that they constantly avoided the areas where the riots took place. The ability to cultivate the land was already limited, as fertile land is a luxury in the North.

The first tribe to systematically engage in agriculture was the [[Dohjil]]. They settled on the Kranor River and cultivated a large area near the coast. Almost all their neighbors attacked them and very soon they ended up fighting every day to defend what they had so laboriously sown. They had to find a way to survive before it was too late.

The sagas say that this way was found by a beaver, who had built a dam to the south of the river. They began to organize and build fortifications, while they strengthened the beaver dam on the river. Traps, walls and towers were set up all around the perimeter of their area with great speed. The Dohjil went a step further and began to make laws about who should build where and when, and assigned shifts to all the sensitive spots.

Subsequent raids failed miserably to break through these defenses. Moreover, when the raiders attacked from the south, the Dohjil opened the dam and the river fell upon them, with great enemy casualties. They did not stop there: they continued to strengthen their defenses, until the place really became impregnable. Many then said that it was Mormankar who had helped them, while others thought that it was just an invention to hide their inability to pass the fortifications.

However, this beaver seems to have been the cause of a major dent in the ideals of the North. On the one hand, the wild tribes who relied mainly on hunting and animal husbandry could not reach the artistry of metals, weapons and tools of the rest, and on the other hand the latter began to make laws for the distribution of agricultural land, defense against threats and the strengthening of fortifications, as well as the development of the administrative system, with Jarls and local lords.

This dividing line was never crossed. Tribes that have not yet made this cut have very different racial and social cohesion, and it is no coincidence that they engage in much more violent raiding and pillaging to meet their needs. Some say that this is an excuse the hunter-gatherers use to atone for their own violent deeds and their own savage society, but who really stays true to the traditions and customs of the North is something that is at stake every day.
