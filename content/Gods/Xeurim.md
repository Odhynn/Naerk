# Xeurim-Xaurim: The two-faced shadow

As the first human civilizations and kingdoms developed, Xeurim-Xaurim quickly found that she could very easily sow discord and doubt within the civilized areas, and this is what she decided to do. She chooses to constantly change forms, plant lies in the ears of various leaders, assassinate important persons, often replacing them with others sympathetic to her cause and use her beauty and charm to influence important persons.

As is often said, Xeurim is the beautiful face of the demon and Xaurim the ugly, depending on the type of work to be done. Among her followers are assassins, spies, advisers. vampires, even thieves, poachers and some merchants. In order to gain power, her subordinate [[demons]] or sorcerers often take over people's bodies and control them secretly. Usually her servants refer to one of the two faces of the goddess, depending on which one suits them, but they all follow the same entity.
