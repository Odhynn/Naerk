The lord of the Shadow plane, Voolthow, had his own powers, the so-called veil of night. He allied himself with Auromia because he had realized that his magic could invade and contaminate a being's spirit and warp it so that it became a puppet in his hands. Furthermore, Voolthow was able to control the material state (i.e. the bodies) of those he infected with his unnatural dark magic. He thus created the undead, some made only of darkness, some bodies in the service of him and his loyal subjects, some beings empowered by him of their own will.

Voolthow at the same time, gained strength by feeding on various emotions. Every emotion of fear, sadness, or hatred uses it to increase its influence, and an experienced subject can harness it to gain strength. Voolthow has now changed his views, and does not wish for the destruction of the Material plane. He believes that if his essence and his creatures can master it, it will be an inexhaustible source of power and authority. Most of his subordinates are of course divided on this question, with some having completely different approaches.
