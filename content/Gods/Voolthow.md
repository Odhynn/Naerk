## Origin

The lord of the Shadow plane, Voolthow, had his own powers, the so-called veil of night. He allied himself with Auromia because he had realized that his magic could invade and contaminate a being's spirit and warp it so that it became a puppet in his hands. Furthermore, Voolthow was able to control the material state (i.e. the bodies) of those he infected with his unnatural dark magic. He thus created the undead, some made only of darkness, some bodies in the service of him and his loyal subjects, some beings empowered by him of their own will.

Voolthow at the same time, gained strength by feeding on various emotions. Every emotion of fear, sadness, or hatred uses it to increase its influence, and an experienced subject can harness it to gain strength. Voolthow has now changed his views, and does not wish for the destruction of the Material plane. He believes that if his essence and his creatures can master it, it will be an inexhaustible source of power and authority. Most of his subordinates are of course divided on this question, with some having completely different approaches.

## History

Among his first and most cunning machinations, was when Voolthow gave [[Vaelasil]], the orb of darkness to [[King Erlamin]] in order to corrupt the [[Edhellin]]. He recognised the terrifying and potentially infinite capacity for continuous evolution of the Edhellin civilization and wanted to exploit their power. The kings' magical ability scared [[Voolthow]], as he believed that in a millenia, he could even pose a danger to the power of the gods. So he took the initiative to give him the magic orb, which in addition to unlimited power, gave its owner arrogance and corruption, concepts that the ancient elven language didn't even have words for to be able to interpret. Within a century, warmongering and hierarchy struggles started the demise of the elves.

## [[Dreamworld]] and [[Twalar]]

As he had been on very friendly terms with [[Hozetul]] in the past, Voolthow could very easily understand how the [[Dreamworld]] worked. The [[Shadow Plane]] and the Dreamworld existed together in the [[Ethereal Plane]], and Voolthow soon found many windows to send his dark magic there, and the nightmares of many creatures became very dark: Voolthow sent shadowfolk and Wayang and other dark creatures there, to use the sleeping folk as his puppets. Some mortals after a few nights of brainwashing even ended up becoming his priests.

Apparently Voolthow also treated the Wayangs he had sent to Dreamworld as his minions, and he couldn't afford to do otherwise. Each of his subordinates in the Dreamworld had several dozen mortals under his influence, and would cause enough trouble with the slightest disobedience. Even so, the Dark Lord's problems didn't start there, but from the nightmares. These were practically parts of Hozetul herself and very quickly grew to resent the presence of the Shadow Plane in particular. Not only was [[Voolthow]] questioning their own influence and authority, but even more, he was breaking the unwritten rules of the Dreamworld: The physical and mental state of the sleeper had to remain intact. Black dragons, flaming goblins, huge birds, and various other nightmares gathered and began their attacks on Voolthow's followers.

These attacks were unexpectedly successful because they specifically targeted only those who interfered with the unwritten rules of not meddling with the physical and spiritual state of the dreamers. Then, the more cowardly, found it in their best interest to ally with the nightmares, as they would escape Voolthow's control. And this alliance was called [[Twalar]]. Their results were multiplicative, as each invader they destroyed saved hundreds of mortals from their torment, and the more mortals Voolthow lost, the harder it was for him to invade the Dreamworld.

Soon Voolthow lost almost all the channels he had to send his dark magic to the Dreamworld. The Wayangs and those who had defected, however, were trapped in the world of dreams. And they knew that if they left thence, Voolthow would hunt them down and bend them to his will, since he punished some exemplarily.

## [[Day of Wild Magic]]

During the [[Day of Wild Magic]], he observed the council and the battle and he couldn't wait to find out how Sylris would handle this crisis and learn the secrets of his time-space magic. Almost a day had passed since the battle began, without any unforeseen events. Voolthow carefully observed the ceremony of the Edhellin mage, but was driven mad because he could not understand how it affected the radiation and changed their nature. Around Sylris glowed beams of energy with dozens of shades of different colors. The sounds of the ritual along with the gentle movements of Sylris produced an lullaby effect with calmness in the atmosphere. This scene irritated Voolthow even more, until the moment came for him to act. He descended in the form of a tall and husky man who wielded an ax over seven feet. He didn't look lordly but he was ready to start a fight.

Sylris looked up to see a gigantic figure emerge from the shadows, wearing a goat skull mask with two holes that draw in light from all the surrounding space, and Sylris was lost in shadows pulling at him. He had already stopped the ritual and his hands began to shake. This was how he had imagined it would feel if he touched the black ball of energy with his hand when he cast the rift in the Veil spell.

Nentha, sensing Sylris's state of mental imbalance, chose to speak first. _"To what do we owe this honor, lord of the Shadows?"_
_"Your young elf friend has pulled it off. He wields magic that even we gods dare not approach. It's time to face the consequences of your actions. This game ends now!"_ Voolthow picked up Sylris with one hand, snatched the orb from him and flung him away.
Seeing Voolthow's action Nentha asks him with irritation _"Since when do the gods have the right to assert their power on the [[Material Plane]]?"_
_"Since your partner stole my personal gift to the Elf King."_
Sylris heared the words of the god of Shadow and found the mental reserves to stand up to him. _"YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ELRAMIN'S DISASTER. YOU ARE THE ONE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MY ACTIONS. So since you want so much to impose order, take this shattered orb with you so we never see it again!"_

Just as Voolthow was about to give his angry reply to the Edhellin mage, [[Yerastu]] appeared before him. An anthropomorphic creature in white and blue robes, twenty foot tall, with a pair of massive wings emerging from its back, created from raw energy. Wonder was painted in Sylris's eyes as, to him, the most absurd thing about Yerastu's invasion was not his descent into the material plane, nor the massive beams of light that surrounded him, but the lack of a face beneath his imposing hood. Accompanying his terrifying presence was a massive execution sword that seemed made not for the needs of a battle but for the dismemberment of souls crossing the Ethereal Plane.

All the momentum Voolthow had gained was suddenly lost. Yerastu took the floor and addressed the Shadow god in a stern tone. _"Who gave you the right to intervene? You have seconds until you finish your dialogue with these mortals and return to your plane."_
Voolthow made a sudden move absorbing a large amount of Vaelasil's magical energy and threw the orb to Sylris' side: _â€œThis orb will remain in the possession of mortals as its power flourishes, corrupting its master's soul. The orb belongs to you. Manage it as you will"_ as he fled for the [[Shadow Plane|Shadow Realm]] with a loud chuckle.
