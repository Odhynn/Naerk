Possibly the most ruthless of all the [[Elemental Lords]], Fyrlean first entered [[Material Plane]] with the creation of the [[Sun]] and [[Reszek]] when he defeated the [[Primordials|Primordial]] [[Querligon]]. He tried to killed [[Fallfaunt]] but his brother, [[Hydarax]], intervened in a battle of epic proportions. He became the lord of the [[Fire Quarter]] and amongst his creations are the firefolk, that live in many warm places of [[Naerk]]. After the [[Winter's War]], Fyrlean wanted to take all the [[Malgyra]], the powerful elemental diamonds, for himself in order to siege command in the whole [[Elemental Ring]], causing a massive conflict within it.
