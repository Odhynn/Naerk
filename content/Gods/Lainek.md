## History

With the spread of [[Kenorex]], peace in many regions came to a violent halt. War broke out in many lands, while the conquered territories groaned under the boot of the Tyrrant army. Many gods and heroes, champions of justice, avoided supporting these regions and their inhabitants. They used excuses like "Whoever wants freedom should avoid urban centers and civilization", "real freedom exists only in nature", "oppression in the occupied territories is insignificant compared to the bloodbath that would follow if there was an uprising", "justice exists, even if it is strict", "it is not right to involve others in the internal problems of a country", "but the people support them".

Against all this, a soul appeared which gained strength over time. It was the ghost of a half-elf teenager in [[Kambah]] who had beaten a guard who was torturing his parents into giving him their little money. The guard hanged him for this deed, however, his soul refused to leave the [[Material Plane]]. The ensuing uprising after his hanging was violently suppressed by the Kenorex, with several villagers dead. The young man's soul attracted the souls of all the martyred victims, and secretly grew stronger. In the following years the soul traveled to all regions that suffered a similar fate, and incorporated the souls of all the victims who fell in the name of injustice, inequality and tyranny, not limited to the Kenorex army.

In an uprising a few years later in Kambah, the souls gathered and supported the rebelling villagers, killing guards and giving spells and power to the citizens. Soon the revolution found itself opposed to [[Sergonial]], and when he ultimately came down and fought the soul aggregation, Lainek, the battle was fierce, for every martyr of the revolution had been added to the power of the rebel souls. Sergonial seemed unprepared for Lainek's fury and determination, and was forced to retreat.

Rumor has it that their battle has never stopped, and that it is constantly and indirectly waged in every similar conflict that has taken place since. Kambah for some years, however, lived in peace and equality. As for Lainek, they created the dimension that represented this entire struggle, where the souls that made up his entity ultimately ended up: [[Zaramel]], the Freedom plane. Many groups, rebels and rebels have reference to Lainek, and there were not a few cases where his involvement in later events was evident.

The martyr souls found rest on the Freedom plane, as Lainek left with godlike power. Their power was finally seen not only to derive from the dead of their ideals, but from the ideals themselves: freedom and equality.
