Lleyn, commonly known as Lady of the Lake, is the newest deity on the planescape of Naerk, ascended mere decades ago under the patronage of Yerastu to fill the previously vacant portfolio of the Moon.

## Origin

### Lady of the Lake

"Lady of the Lake" was a title given to the gatekeepers of the ancient skyportal of Edhailin, the Lake of the Moon.
Situated in eastern [[Athalaar]] just opposite the Selanaari peninsula and close to [[Mitheryn]] forest, Edhailin served as the arrival gate of the sky passages that arced through [[Qusm|the Cosmodrome]] to distant worlds, and has always tended to by a Lady of the Lake, much like [[Eltirion]] (the departure gate of the sky passages) has always been tended to by a Prophetess Under the Mountain.

Every Lady of the Lake was expected to take in a score of young women under her tutelage and prepare them to potentially succeed her; these were called the Maidens of the Lake.
While the Lady of the Lake would have to always remain near Edhailin to the end of her long watch, the Maidens were expected to travel far and wide. Thus, when the time would come to choose a new Lady of the Lake among them, the girl would have had the chance to see the world and be wise and patient enough before she would give up her name and be confined to stand guard over Edhailin for the rest of her life.

Whenever travellers would come through the Qusmic sky passages to Naerk, they would typically appear in the sky as falling stars, arcing round [[Qusm|the Cosmodrome]] and materialising into the lake. The Lady of the Lake would see them emerge from the waters and soothe and shelter them until they could adapt to the world, while keeping the fluctuating energies of the portal from getting out of control.

This role was traditionally held by elven matrons until the [[Harrowing of Athalaar]]. After the cataclysm caused the demise of the Lady, her Maidens, and the athalaari elves in general, Yerastu arranged for the mantle to be henceforth borne by duskwalkers, reincarnations of past Ladies, so that Edhailin would not be left alone to disastrously unwind as Eltirion did. 

Lleyn was a Lady of the Lake since the 46th century, the 65th of her name.
On her watch she received a number of offworld travellers who would have a dramatic impact on Naerk's history, including Faenyss Laffirdul, [[Shizu the Swordmaiden]], the [[6th Sentinels of the Silver Flame]], and last but evidently not least, [[Sennarin#the Arrival|the entirety of the Sennarii people]].

## Ascension

When the Arrival took place in 4790, [[Angaeradh]] saw the torrent of falling stars in the sky, coming from the depths of space to be caught in Qusm's orbit, and knew the time had at last come: she had had long foreseen, and long awaited, the return of elves in Athalaar, and those elves, though few, were among those falling stars.

As was her duty as the Prophetess of the Mountain, she bade the Lady of the Lake to prepare to receive the travellers, but also to be advised that they come in the thousands. The Lady of the Lake knew this spelled ill news for the portal, for it would be near impossible to keep its energies from fluctuating out of control if it should remain open while all those people came through.
In such unique circumstances, a Lady of the Lake was typically allowed to shut the portal and divert the incoming travellers into the cold void to avoid risking the gate's integrity. Lleyn chafed at the prospect of condemning all those people to oblivion, and asked the Prophetess, who was technically her superior and had bitter experience with unstable portal gates, for her orders on what to do. Angaeradh ordered her to hold the portal open at all costs.

Thus, when the first Sennarii began washing out of the Lake, bewildered they gazed upon the Lady hovering above the centre of the whirling waters, her form beaming with raw magic tinged by moonlight. As by the thousands they staggered to the shore, they witnessed her strain and scream in agony and effort and saw the power gush through the ley lines on the ground and through the waters to her.
When at last the last of them had passed through, the magical storm subsided. Exhaling with relief, the Lady dropped lifelessly into the water. Immediately dozens of the Sennarii who were pearl divers in their homeworld jumped back into the lake and retrieved her body from within its dark depths.

Holding a mass wake was the first thing the Sennarii did on Naerk. By the thousands they camped around Edhailin, placing flowers by her body and lighting fires to warm themselves and burn the incense they had brought.
They lamented the destruction of the homeworld they had to flee, and they mourned what they saw as the kind goddess who eased their flight into her own world at the cost of her life.
Yerastu looked on, and decided that this circumstance of dutiful self-sacrifice, mass reverence, and residual energy, it called for an ascension of the Lady's soul.
While initially the bar of his patronage was at the level of Golden Emissary, the Sennarii kept revering the Lady of the Lake in the following months as they settled in contemporary Sennarin, and this pious expression only strengthened the Lady's coalescing divinity to the point where she eventually materialised in the planespace as Lleyn, the Demigoddess of the Moon.

While at a high council of the divine guardians of Athalaar, Angaeradh, who was formerly the Lady's superior, wondered internally if in light of those events divinity was also not out of the question for her, once her eternity of duty came to an end; all she had to do was die fulfilling her role and she could become a Goddess of Stars or Time.
Sensing the rise of terrible ambition within her, Yerastu reminded her that in contrast to Lleyn, she was not serving an enlistment, she was serving a sentence.

## Following

Lleyn's follower base consists largely of the Sennarii, who revere her as their patron goddess. Usually this is done in conjunction with reverence towards their very own Swordmaiden Serene as well; after all they were sent on their journey across realms by one luminous lady and received by the other. They are often referred to as O-Shizukami-sama and Tsukizumikami-sama, respectively.
