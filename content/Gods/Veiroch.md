## History

Veiroch was once a [[Kenemi]], one of those sent by Sergonial to the Abyss to [[Eternal Slaughter|fight]] the [[demons]]. He was an imposing presence, a huge armored titan with many arms and weapons. Veiroch was practically second-in-command after [[Sergonial]]. Veiroch was considerably more violent, constantly fighting on the front lines and torturing the souls of the demons he captured in battle. Although he was on good terms with Sergonial, at intervals when he returned to [[Tailway]], he found [[Yerastu]] increasingly regretting the campaign. So, he decided to take initiative.

Initially, he managed to gain the trust of his subordinates. He created a close circle, around him who were in constant fear of his punishment, a punishment that everyone knew how severe it would be. Veiroch placed a high value on life and believed in repentance, so he was of the opinion that there was no one who could not be completely brought under his authority by proper "persuasion" and at the same time convinced that he would not go astray. The same authority was exercised in the lower levels of hierarchy by his subordinates, and at the top of this pyramid were the [[Painbringers]], captains and soldiers of Veiroch.

As a group the Painbringers differed greatly from the rest of the Kenemi. Among them were deformed Kenemi, warriors who had deserted but had been "persuaded" not to desert again, captive demons forced into permanent military service on the front lines, and other strange creatures. And this is because Veiroch in the [[Tailway]], since he had great jurisdiction, could handpick those he thought would be most useful to him, and secretly take them from [[Yerastu]]'s service to bolster his ranks. Thus he gradually strengthened his position while at the same time being one of the main reasons that the [[Eternal Slaughter]] lasted so long, as the Kenemi armies were fed and disciplined.

Veiroch became famous because he was among those most disfigured by the battle. The original brave warrior had mutated into a dark figure, covered in blood, his weapons of justice turned into tools of torture and intimidation. His mere presence was often enough to drive away enemies and convince his subordinates, and Sergonial believed that since his actions helped achieve their purpose, they should be tolerated and welcome.

Therefore, it is no coincidence that during the creation of [[Hell]], Veiroch gained even greater prestige. He took a vast area for himself and fashioned it into a landscape of constant pain and calamity, where he brought the Painbringers: the [[Red Corner]]. The ultimate punishments decreed by Sergonial and his generals were carried out here, and the mere thought of someone ending up in the hands of the Tormentor was often enough to keep him from straying.
