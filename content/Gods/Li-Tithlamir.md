A sovereign archangel that fought numerous times over countless millenia the fiend armies of [[Hell]] and [[Abyss]]. She was respected and honored in [[Fortress of the Just]] as a great strategist and entity of valor. She took part in the [[Unnamed Judgement]] to punish the abuse of the [[Rod of Stone and Steel]] and used her [[Solarium Ring]] to bind and lock the Rod. She was summoned to fight in [[The Eruption]] the [[Erevi]] forces and she killed three Titan leaders single-handedly and the last one with the help of [[Lo-Ukmasid]]. That titan gravely injured her and she fell shortly after the [[Amehan]] forces dissolved. Upon her death, she was reincarnated into the powerful [[Le-Hara]] celestial emissary.
