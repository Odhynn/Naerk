[[Yast]] is a self-exiled [[Primordial]] and [[Auromia]]'s son. He understood, albeit belatedly, her plans and considered that trying to co-exist with the material plane as the highest treason. He wanted no contact with the material dimension and was afraid of it. From the beginning he gathered all his strength to destroy it. However, [[Malahir]]'s influence usually prevents the attacks and incursions of his ethereal beings into the material world. Yast eventually became qurious of the material world and tried to send spies to understand it.

In recent times, his creatures meddled with the devotees of [[Merkal]] and tried to invade from a passage at [[Mherg Tundra]], the events prior to [[Vethfall]].
