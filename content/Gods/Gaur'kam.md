An orcish hero from [[Heyarosh]] that defied the constant lightning strikes of [[Drokasner]].

he cult of orcs in [[Drokasner|Thunderstrike]] began with a seemingly random event. A bolt of lightning struck an ancient blacksmith and knocked him down. His skin turned dark, his face distorted and he looked like he was dying. Then the creature, bleeding from its damaged nose and mouth, rose to its knees and cried out to the clouds, challenging him.

_"That's all you can do?"_

A second flash followed, and then a third. But the creature was able to get back up, and it seemed to absorb the power from the electricity. The next two bolts of lightning flashed past and struck his open arms, and then the creature began to laugh. Drokasner was determined to crush him for his arrogance, but then he realized that was not his role, and he did not want to alter natural phenomena for his own desires. He let the creature go, and soon the storm stopped.

On the contrary, the [[Aspects|Aspect]] acquired special interest in the blacksmith. He belonged to a clan that lived in western [[Tarhelm]], in [[Heyarosh]]. His experience with lightning gave him great strength and respect among his tribe, as they saw his survival as a sign of his status and power. They named him [[Gaur'kam]], the thunderkissed. Drokasner took a liking to him, and carved a protective rune into his chest where the first lightning had struck him. At the same time, however, many treated him with derision and prejudice, believing that his mere presence was a nuisance for the village.

So five of them conspired one night to kill him. Now that they had a good idea of his strength, they decided to do it in concert. They entered his room and stuck their knives into his body at the same time. But upon touching the metal on his body, it discharged a massive electrical shock, centered on the rune etched on his chest. The lightning threw them all back, filling them with wounds. This discharge, however, because it originated from the blacksmith himself and not from Drokasner, had a different effect. His power passed through the lightning to these five traitors, and he himself cooled down.

The five conspirators survived the rune, but found that they had sustained the same injuries as the blacksmith. At first they began to fear that it was a curse, but they soon found that they had come out strengthened by it. Then they feared that they would be punished by their fellow villagers, or even worse, by Drokasner. People had begun to gather around the house, as everyone had been awakened by the thunder. In the little time they had at their disposal, they discussed and found a solution.

They went out of the house with a humble look, and one of them spoke. He said that [[Gaur'kam]] had invited them to his home to share his power with them, but with this thunder over the ceremony he had lost his cool. He said that he appointed them heirs of his inheritance, and that they were to share his power with all the people. However, few believed him. He tried as much as he could to patch up their act and said that they were trying to contribute to the good of the village, because they had partially regretted their act. Drokasner was angry, but felt that the situation had gotten out of hand. They believed that they would most likely be murdered, or even worse, tortured to death, for murdering the village hero. The villagers had found the knives in the room, and they were all bloody.

Then, continuing the theater, he said that a funeral ceremony had to be held to complete the ceremony. They were to collect all the iron of the village in the blacksmith's house, weapons, armor and tools, and tear down the roof so that the Act could be seen. At the same time, the entire village had to touch the pile of metals during the ceremony. The watching Drokasner had unwittingly gathered many dark clouds over the village and muffled rumblings could already be heard.

Surprisingly, bad weather and two wise shamans who held prestige persuaded most of the inhabitants, and did as the conspirator told them. They made all the irons a heap on the anvil, and all touched a metal piece. They tore down the roof so that it faced the sky and placed the corpse on the anvil. The conspirators believed that they would be immune to electricity, and that the entire village would die from lightning, so all five touched the anvil.

Drokasner lingered a little longer, until he gathered enough power and fury over the village, and the ensuing lightning bolt shook the whole place. The five conspirators were reduced to ash, acting as a conduit to channel the power to the rest of the village. The power of this lightning had touched a note in their race that seemed untapped, as if everyone possessed this power, and simply needed the lightning-catalyst to awaken. The metals melted, and once the thunder stopped, the race had now taken the form of the orcs of today, with tusks, flat noses, and immense strength.

Gaur'kam's tomb became one of the most important orc monuments, this molten mass of metal. His body was never found, but the place became especially fertile, and now and then a lightning strikes the grave. Even the [[Leylines]] of the place embraced the point, and it is often a place for ceremonies and a source of magical power. Since that day, the "Passing of the Spark" has existed in orc lore.

This is a peculiar code by which one orc can channel power into another, and the most common way is in duels, where the victor takes a piece of the other's power: and it is customary in such duels for the opponents to use weapons and armor made entirely of metal and dueling in storms. In fact, on rare occasions, lightning strikes a gladiator's steel, turning him into Drokasner's Chosen. This event also often attracts [[Kensalea]], the Wrath of the Storm, from nearby [[Paltenach]].
