## Origins

As [[Malahir]] began to create increasingly sophisticated and complex life forms, her servants and assistants followed suit as they forged new creatures. One of them, however, decided to follow a different path: Sseratush. He began to create cold-blooded animals, with scales instead of hair, the reptiles.

His creations had several notable differences from the other animals. Some were amphibious, some were huge, some had no legs at all, and soon the dinosaurs and turtles were followed by even primitive life forms such as lizardfolk, viperfolk and saurians.

The existence of life forms with intelligence and souls, however, did not appeal to Malahir at all. The goddess of life was particularly annoyed at Sseratush's exploits, but she soon found that she could not simply wipe out so many creatures without affecting the food chain and cycle of life. Se was able to confine them to the most tropical, hot and humid climates, and she extracted from Sseratush himself the promise that the evolution of these creatures would follow the pace of the rest.
