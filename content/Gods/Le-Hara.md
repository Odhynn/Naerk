Le-Hara is the reincarnation of the souls of four archangels. These were [[Li-Tithlamir]], [[Lo-Ukmasid]], [[La-Vermenel]] and [[Lu-Peng]]. The four of them had previously fought many battles against the forces of [[Hell]] and the [[Abyss]], and were considered among the best generals of the [[Fortress of the Just]]. One after another over the centuries they met death in battle, often fighting against outnumbered opponents or trying to save someone in vain. Every time someone died, their soul went to inhabit the next angel. When the latter also died, their souls united and reincarnated into Le-hara, a mighty angel with four arms and eight wings. Lehara deals with strategy, wisdom and battles against the forces of evil. He is one of [[Laerion]]'s strongest allies.
