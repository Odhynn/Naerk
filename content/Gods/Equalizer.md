The [[Primordial]] that defined [[Material Plane]] and the way the other beings could interact to it by winning the [[Primordial War]]. He created [[Nahema]] and [[Amehan]] to add or remove essence from his creation, and afterwards [[Sigard]] to maintain peace. The instances that he intervenes in the affairs of the Material Plane are very few but critical, like when he destroyed [[Veth]] as he defied his creation. No one knows if he is content with the work his three loyalists are doing or if he fears for his integrity if he appears on the material world.
