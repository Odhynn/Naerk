One of the most mysterious beings in [[Zaramel]], Halaniel is particularly antisocial. She rarely talks to anyone, and most of her actions are learned after she performs them. Her main goal is to free souls that have been turned into undead, as well as those trapped in the [[Dreamworld]]. He has a particular hatred for nightmares and vampires, as well as anyone who manipulates or controls someone against their will. Some say she was [[Hozetul]]'s little sister, but no one can confirm that except perhaps the [[Primordials]]. Halaniel is considered a patron of children, the disabled and beggars, while most of her subjects are particularly humble.
