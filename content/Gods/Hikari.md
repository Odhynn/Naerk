Hikari was missing for a long time. He was once a mortal who had been able to take his place among the Heavens because of his repeated triumphs. He participated in the [[Unnamed Judgment]], built seven monasteries and three temples of [[Yerastu]], organized the entire religion, and was one of the users of the mighty [[Shiji-sha]] katana. Hikari at the time of his disappearance was guarding the imprisoned [[Vethians|Vethian]] [[Rhekvethor]], a duty he had personally undertaken. He recently reappeared and killed the massive red dragon [[Solusmheir]] when the latter attacked Yerastu's temple in [[Ilistair]]. He then took his rightful place in the Heavens. Guardians, protectors and sentinels often pray to him to help them in their watch and keep their eyes open in difficult times.
