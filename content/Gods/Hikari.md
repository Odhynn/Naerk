Kashiwa Hikari was once a mortal who has been able to take his place among the Heavens because of his repeated triumphs. He participated in the [[Unnamed Judgment]], built seven monasteries and three temples of [[Yerastu]], organized the entire religion, and was one of the users of the mighty [[Shiji-sha]] katana and a respected and honourable high priest and proven warrior in battle, before disappearing for milennia.
At the time of his disappearance was guarding the imprisoned [[Vethians|Vethian]] [[Rhekvethor]], a duty he had personally undertaken after initiating the [[Unnamed Judgement]] that condemned him, [[Salkor]], and [[Tavethir]].

Hikari reappeared in 4777 to confront the massive red dragon [[Solusmheir]] when the latter attacked Yerastu's temple in [[Ilistair]] with his [[Bloodscale]] troops, channeling his powers through his descendant [[Shizu]] in an epic battle that killed the elder wyrm.
He then took his rightful place in the Heavens. Guardians, protectors and sentinels often pray to him to help them in their watch and keep their eyes open in difficult times.
