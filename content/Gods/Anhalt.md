## Defence of Kadrom

In the old days, a few centuries after the [[Ghost War]], the dark elves, also known as drow, arrived in their swift ships from the far south and inhabited many islands. One of these was [[Urgol]], to the west of North Darrok. Their colony there was soon reinforced with powerful wizards. Apparently, their dreams of expansion didn't end there. So they tried to invade [[North Darrok]] and take over the dwarven strongholds.

Their first target was the fortress of [[Kadrom]]. Built on a rocky island, it was an advanced sea dwarven outpost, and one of the oldest. It was connected underground to a network of galleries and to the rest of the fortresses, and was the first step for the elven invasion. So they assembled a fleet of a hundred ships, and a powerful sorcerer summoned an entire company of devils to aid them in battle.

The dwarves decided to leave the safety of their fortress then and take up positions along the coast. They preferred this mainly to not give the drow time to unload their supplies, siege equipment, and carve teleportation runes. So the first [[devils]] to land found the dwarven battalions waiting for them in solid formations, and the melee began. Anhalt was then a simple young sergeant.

The battle that followed was fierce. The dwarven catapults greeted the demonic beings with a volley of missiles, and their warriors, experienced in battle, were able to withstand the fiends' onslaught for some time. But it was obvious that they were at a disadvantage against creatures that had inexhaustible reserves of magic, physical strength and endurance. The dwarves gradually began to retreat and the drow slowly began to disembark. It was obvious that they could not last long.

The guard captain of [[Kadrom]], then, made a difficult decision. He asked a group of volunteers to hold the line of defense against the fiends as long as possible, while the rest, in a wedge formation, would break through the drow lines alongside and kill the mage who summoned the beasts from hell. Among the volunteers was Anhalt, determined not to take a step back.

Then the [[devils]] attacked a second time, and Anhalt came face to face with their leader. It was a huge creature, over fifteen feet tall, with horns, wings, and purple scales. With one movement, he summoned fires from hell that charred everyone near Anhalt, while he escaped because he was further ahead of the flames. With singular courage and bravery he began to trade blows with the creature, and seemed to hold his ground well. His armor and shield were of adamantium, and they could withstand the blows as he pounded the devil's feet with his hammer.

The dwarf kept the creature busy for quite some time. It was his duty to keep, he had to give time to others. Finally, it was able to grab the dwarf, and he opened his mouth to swallow him. Then Anhalt threw his hammer into the mouth with force, and the devil choked. It let him fall and began to cough, trying to clear his throat. He then continued to pound the dwarf, who feebly parried the monster's blows at a slower and slower rate, until he finally went cold. Still, he didn't take a single step back.

As the devil went to continue the slaughter, he felt his body degenerate and return to hell. The sentinel had managed to kill the sorcerer while Anhalt kept the head of the army busy, and the demonic army turned to dust. Then the dwarves attacked the remaining drow with renewed morale, and chased them back to their ships.

[[Kromlek]], the god of war, pulled on Anhalt's chain to return him to [[Kelzadam]], only to find it unliftable. He applied force, but it wouldn't budge an inch. The power of his will was so great, that even after death his soul remained motionless in this place. The dwarves of Kadrom, impressed by his sacrifice and devotion to duty, buried him in the same spot where he died, and placed upon the grave his broken shield and molten hammer.

Impressed by Anhalt's fortitude, Kromlek decided to take him on as his assistant. He broke the chain and gave him divine power. The soul chain rattles when there is danger near the grave, and he undertook to protect and help those in similar need as he had then. His feat became known far and wide, and the drow never attacked North Darrok again. Anhalt is one of the few cases of dwarven gods who were able to gain respect and followers even among other races.
