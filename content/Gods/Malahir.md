## ÎŸrigin

The [[Primordial]] entity that emerged from the [[Primordial War]]. After cooperating with [[Auromia]] and creating [[Ethereal Plane]], she brought life upon [[Na'erk]] utilising the help of the [[Elemental Lords]]. She quickly proved to be the only one who possessed so many secrets about the spirit realm. Realizing her worth, [[Nahema]] and the Elemental lords (outside of [[Fyrlean]]) helped her, so she built her own kingdom that later became known as the [[Evergrowing Forest]]. With the breath of life coming from [[Reszek]], the first souls were formed. It was not long, though, that many life forms found their own free will and started making their own independent choices. A huge portion of the natural world, though, still believes in her primal power and calls upon her aid.

## Intervention

With her intervention and Reszek, and through her servant, an enchanted Lantwirl tree, [[Laerion]] and [[Factar]] were empowered and eventually ascended as gods.
