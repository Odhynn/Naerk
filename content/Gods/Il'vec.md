## History

One of the lesser-known [[Aspects]] of ancient times was Il'vec, the Locust Blight. This aspect, although it shared many similarities with the others, was not the most liked. And this because it acted particularly parasitically, reaping the labors of others while constantly eating plants and corpses. However, it also had followers, who were often so miserable, filthy, and hungry vagabonds that they were often mistaken for followers of the Demon Lord [[Disiklek]].

As much as everyone loathed her, however, [[Malahir]] found her presence useful. The Locust Blight coordinated many parasitic insects, fungi and decomposers to destroy organic or living matter and clear the landscape, often deforesting entire areas. With her contribution the cycle of life and the food chain could be completed. The void left by Malahir and other Aspects could be filled with new creations.

## [[Ghost War]]

And this faith of Malahir to Il'vec was no false. As soon as the [[Ghost War]] broke out, the Locust Gluttony rushed to the front lines of the war, wreaking havoc in the ranks of [[Auromia]]'s army. Her attack was so fierce that she found herself inside the enemy lines, along with her swarm, slaughtering ghosts and undead. However, her zeal cost her, for when [[Volrek]] finally transported the Evergrowing Forest and the battle to the [[Material Plane]], she herself had entered the [[Ethereal Plane]] so deeply that she was trapped there, surrounded by enemies.

## Aftermath

Four decades later, Il'vec found a way to return to the [[Material Plane]]. However, her years in the [[Ethereal Plane|Fifth Dimension]] left her with unhealed wounds. She came into contact with the [[Shadow Plane]] and the undead souls of [[Voolthow]], and her very survival was a constant and daily battle. In the end, she had reached the brink of madness. Her paranoid behavior manifested immediately when she returned to the material dimension: Il'vec began devouring everything, creatures large and small, animals and plants. Her entire flock responded to her call. As they obeyed her blindly, all her creatures, mostly insects, began to rampage and devour everything in a large area. This area is the present-day [[Allwick]] Desert, an inhospitable, empty expanse that even today has few forms of life in its vast expanse.

Many [[druids]] and creatures of nature strove to curb her destructive fury, aided in this effort by other [[Aspects]] as well as [[Zulhan]] empire. As it proved impossible to bring her back to her senses, they were forced to destroy her physical existence. However, the problem was not over. As Voolthow had managed to corrupt her, her power had become very dark, and her presence in the [[Ethereal Plane]] was still significant. The form she took was a mighty nightmare. Once her physical form was destroyed, she escaped to [[Dreamworld]] and began attacking the fireflies there. She began driving sleeping creatures mad, filling their dreams with paranoia and madness, and turned them into hungry husks that had completely submitted to her will.

Over the centuries, she found that if she could force herself into the sleep of a powerful enough creature, then she could return to the [[Material Plane]] with the host's body again. This opportunity presented itself to an ancient green dragon, sleeping in a remote forest. Gradually she was able to control and dominate the creature, and began to pass into the material dimension a second time.

But her efforts were noticed by a goblin shaman who lived in the area. The shaman informed all the circles of druids and shamans, and they quickly gathered from all over to stop her. This time, however, they found that the same scenario would be repeated if they destroyed her physical body. The wiser ones found that her material body could imprison her soul so that it would remain there. So with the help of many creatures, dragons and outsiders, they were able to restrain the dragon and managed with a powerful spell to turn it to stone permanently, with the soul equally trapped in a coma.

The stone dragon was buried deep underground, in a place that is still unknown. However, many of her servants managed to escape after the battle and were able to partially regroup. They formed an extremist group of druids and shamans, who believe that civilization and nature are growing out of control and the only way to restore balance is to free Il'vec. The efforts of this group, which became known as The [[Locust Blight]], however, remain fruitless.
