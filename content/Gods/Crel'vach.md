As [[Malahir]] began to create the spirits of the first animals, they gradually began to take form in the [[Material Plane]]. From the first micro-organisms, to more and more complete forms of life, gradually the cycle of life developed and evolved. One of Malahir's main assistants at this time was Crel'vach, although she had not yet acquired that name.

With the appearance of the large mammals, Crel'vach appeared to [[Naerk]] in the form of a huge grizzly bear. Crel'vach found a cave in the north of the [[Hlafentar]] Mountains, and chose it as the den for her forays. At first she was excited about the creation of nature and life. She hunted small animals, ate sardines in the rivers and honey from the beehives, dug holes, carved trees and smelled the many different smells of the forest, things that were unimaginable in the [[Ethereal Plane]]. By all accounts she seemed to be most content with animals and plants in the material plane.

But things changed when the first intelligent beings appeared in the North. Although in the land she was in, [[Korhond]], there were humans, orcs, and elves, only the first two were close to the [[Hlafentar]], and her first contact with humanoids was those two races. The first to appear in her cave were hunters, warriors who killed for food from various tribes. Then one of them thought that Crel'vach, in bear form, was his prey, a trophy of singular value, and though there were many other animals around to hunt, he chose to attack the [[Aspects|aspect]].

The bear was shocked when it saw the hunter's spear impaling its fur. She herself had attacked many creatures for food, whereas no one had ever seen her as food before. She felt an unprecedented emotion wash over her: Rage. This feeling was strengthened by the fact that she knew that food was not the only reason she was being hunted, but it was also the prestige and respect her killer would gain. This anger she violently externalized, melting the hunter into the cave wall.

In the following years Crel'vach decided to take an aggressive stance in her area. The hunters that came near the cave did so at the risk of their lives and gradually began to avoid the place. One day, however, the bear saw smoke in the distance, and went to investigate. She found that someone had set fire to the forest, and it had developed into a large wildfire. Many animals and plants were burned, and as far as she could tell it was for no reason at all. The feeling of rage appeared a second time, and now it was uncontrollable. For the first time in a long time she came out of her territory and started attacking villages and towns until she calmed down.

The third time she was overcome with rage was when some warriors were calling her name in battle. As a supernatural being, he was able to hear them and went to see them, intending to make them repent. She was in a battle at [[Kran√•rvikk]], where two armies clashed, the smaller of which was the one calling her out. The warriors fought with too much courage and valor, but they gradually retreated as they were greatly outnumbered. The bear prepared to help them, but thought she had already exceeded her role as an aspect. She realised there were now many who believed in it in many places, and this battle was only an indication.

Then, she decided to return to the [[Evergrowing Forest]], feeling a sense of satiety. However, before she left, she breathed into the souls of these warriors the flame of rage that had been imprinted on her for so many years. The warriors fought like beasts, and were able to defeat the opposing barbarian tribe, in a battle with many casualties on both sides. And the souls of the dead were welcomed in Crel'vach's cave in the Evergrowing Forest, a place ever growing with brave warriors, who come to add their own exploits to its frescoes, and drink mead with their patron, the Bear's Fury.

As for the tribe that won, it became one of the largest tribe inhabiting the entire [[Korhond]]. Their flag is a grizzly bear claw, and they are now known as the [[Crel]], their warriors considered among the fiercest in all of the North.
