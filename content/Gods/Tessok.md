In the city of [[Derlantin]], in [[Oromil]], King Tessok once ruled. This particularly ambitious king had a vision: to unite all the individual regions of the then Oromil under a single authority: his own. However, his resources were not sufficient for this purpose. It was then that he was visited one night by [[Xeurim]], who had long known of his ambitions.

Xeurim offered him the money and influence he wanted. He was able to hire some lesser kings and mercenaries, seduce some stubborn ones, and finally after four victorious battles, Tessok was able to unify Oromil. When he finally had the entire country under his control, Xeurim prompted him to go one step further: Attack the country of [[Kultaria]]. Tessok reluctantly refused, for although his army was strong, it could in no way compare to Kultaria, while he himself felt satisfied with his achievements.

Enraged that Tessok refused her, the demon lord decided to abandon him to his fate. It was then that his ineptitude became apparent: Rebellions broke out in the south, mercenaries became independent, Kultarian army began to advance on the [[Erkenmoors]], crushing all resistance, while the nobles began to conspire against him. Within a month, Tessok had been arrested, having lost all support, and was publicly executed at the stake.

But they couldn't get rid of him. In the darkest lairs of the abyss, there is still a demon, charred, with the crown still on his head. A being that has completely lost its former glory, and seeks revenge on Xeurim. Bad decisions, unattainable ambitions and hatred often lead to his lairs in the [[Abyss]].
