One of the most powerful Vethians and the creator of the Rod of Stone and Steel. Rhekvethor, a being of unimaginable power and a friend of [[Maeronian]], the god of magic, loved to travel to the most distant places and dimensions. Obviously, he wasn't well-received everywhere and was constantly changing his form, a skill he was particularly good at. He gathered knowledge and experience from many places, while befriending various powerful wizards and creatures from other dimensions in his many wanderings. And one day Rhekvethor set a goal in his life.

His dream was to be able to control the element of earth, specifically stone, minerals, metals and subsoil. To be able to make whatever he wants from these materials in colossal scale. And so he spent an infinite amount of time, using all his resources and experiences to make a scepter that would allow him to accomplish his goal.
