How could we appreciate Hansa if there was always such a Hansa?”

Yushan is one of the most curious deities of Na'erk. That is, fir he did not begin as one. He is as old as existence itself, born as a [[primordial]] mysterious almighty beings that have vanished (or almost vanished, but that is a tale for another time) from the face of the multiverse. While most were beings of grandiose violence, majesty and a timeless immensity, the Liar Eternal was at the time of a more academic sort.
It is unclear what transpired during the [[Primordial War]], but it is known Yushan came something less than before from it. According to the few priests that had received a non-cryptic answer, it was somewhat of his own accord, and he remained hidden from the emerging powers thereafter fir millennia.
Yushan revealed himself first to a man named [[Hansa]], a wandering healer that lost his faith in his deity after witnessing a great catastrophe. This trend has continued to today. The majority of his followers are "second handed', those who question their faith often become attracted to Yushan.
Yushan's temples are more a mix of a monastery and a library, reclusive, hidden places where the faithful can meditate on the secrets of the universe, or catalogue the accumulated knowledge of generations upon generations of scholar priests. A number of academics, loremasters and entertainers  also pay homage to Yushan.
Yushan has a relative small number of clerics and oracles dedicated to him, but he is far more active with them than other gods. He oftenly sends them messages through cryptic dreams or subtle messages through the material plane. An oddly shaped rock falling on the students head, a book written backwards, or even Yushan himself in a disguise. It falls to the follower to decrypt the message.
One of the greatest paradoxes of the Yushan priesthood is that their constant search for knowledge has little to no meaning to them. A book filled with forbidden magics is of little interest to them by itself. Its through the decryption and pursuit of it, and the experience gained thereof, that the student sees the veil slowly parted from their eyes, and see the world for what truly is: A house of water, a lie, but a beautiful lie.
Scholar-priests of Yushan , when not tending their temples, go onto long pilgrimages in a nigh obsessive search of information. The data they collect is largely subjective, for to them, all knowledge is equal to pursue enlightenment. While one may gather whatever scraps of  texts they can find on a long forgotten empire, another may search for the most lovely recipe of apple pie.


Symbol: A white hollow circle, symbolizing the circularity of existence. Most followers have it tatooed on their brow.

Excerpts of the Tome of True Lies, the holy book of Yushan.

**THE SIX EDICTS OF YUSHAN**
1. Yushan said: let there not be a genesis, for beginnings are false and I am a consummate liar.
2. The full of it is this – the circular existence of Gods is the perfection of matter.
3. Yushan lied once and said he had nine hundred and ninety nine thousand names. This is true, but it is also a barefaced lie.
4. Living is an exercise of paradoxes. Exercise of paradoxes is the fate of living. Yushan understands that fate being paradoxical is a paradox itself, and is amused by that.
5. Paradoxes are circular. Perception is not circular and lacks flawlessness- therefore, rejoice in imperfect things, for their rareness is not lacking!
6. Only an idiot cannot place his absolute certainty in paradoxes. The divine is a perfect paradox. A man cannot exist without paradoxes – that is the full of it.



## The five paradoxical truth-lies of Yushan

1. It was once said that Yushan had many names. This is true, but all of them are false save the name Yushan, which in itself is a paradox.
2. Yushan is the weakest thing there is and the smallest crawling thing, and the worm upon the earth and in the earth.
3. Yushan is capable of contemplating nothing.
4. To speak general truths about Yushan is to lie intimately; in truth one must learn the tongues but the matter remains that Yushan is the unparalleled master of the fundamental art of lying. The best practice of lying is self deception.
5. Yushan once said: ‘Selfish tongues revolt and refuse to invert the contents of their brains – even if it were a lie, this insurrection of our flesh would do us great offense.’


##  I. The Parable of the giant and the ant.
Yushan sat once with his disciple Hansa in Yushan’s palace. Hansa was one of his most ardent students and a grand questioner of Yushan. He posessed a miserly scrutiny and a heart of iron nails.
Hansa’s questions were thus:
‘Lord, how must I question space?’
‘With an age, an ant may encircle a giant five million times,’ spoke Yushan.
‘Lord, how then may I question time?’
‘A giant’s stride takes an ant a week to surpass.’ Yushan spoke and smiled .
Hansa was discontent with this answer and rubbed the stem of his long and worn pipe which he always kept with him.
‘Lord, then which should I be, the giant or the ant?’
‘Both,’ spoke Yushan,’ or either, when it suits you. '
Hansa contemplated this in silence. Later he would recount this proverb to his daughter.


## II. The tale the iron plum
There was once a succubus named Payam who  ruled a palace of burnished gold and fire and dispensed malice in all things. It was let known once that Payam had grown an extraordinary plum – enormous in size, with adamant skin that was burnished as a breastplate and fifty times as hardy. Payam was desirous of a pillow friend of fiery heart and excellent skill with their mouth and let know that whosoever could break the skin of that plum with their teeth she would swear to share her bed with for three nights in whatever disposition they may desire.
Many demons, mortals and gods were in attendance at Payam’s hall on the first day, and even more on the second day, but by the third day of this strange contest few remained who had not tested their mettle, for the plum remained implacable and immaculate and turned many away with sore teeth and roiling frustration in their brains. A great cry rose up and Yushan was called forth from his palace. In companionship with Yushan was Hansa, who followed along.
“See this Payam!” cried the crowd. “She deceives us! "
Yushan was very fond of plums and immediately grasped the iron plum and took a long, succulent bite, praising its merits to the amazement of all.
“How!” wailed the attended.
“Why, it is a plum of flesh, and quite ripe as well,” said Yushan plainly, and indeed, it was apparent to those gathered that it was the case. The plum was passed around and touched and indeed it was sensual and soft and pliant. Hansa was not so convinced. “It is still a plum of iron,” said he, “there is some trickery here, oh master of masters.”
“Indeed, it is so,” said Yushan, and it was again apparent to those gathered that the flesh of that plum was as hard and impermeable as a fortress. “How can it be so?” said Hansa, “How comes this fickle nature? Plums and the fifty winds are not so alike I think.”
Yushan said, “I told you of this and, believing it, it was so. In truth, it is whichever you prefer. In truth, there is no plum at all, just as there is no Yushan.  A plum has no shape, form, or color at all, in truth, but these are all things I find pleasing about it. A plum has no taste at all for it has no flesh or substance, but I find its sweetness intoxicating. A plum is a thing that does not exist. But it is my favorite fruit.”
“A pipe is a thing that does exist, and it is my favorite past time,” said Hansa, lacking understanding, and growing in cynicism.
“What a paradox!” said Yushan, smiling, “I shall share my love tenderly with Payam.”


## III. The story of the water house

Yushan and Hansa walked the planes once, drinking plum wine.
“Dearest Hansa,” spoke Yushan, after a moment, as they strolled along an expanse of fractal glass and cold fire, “Would you like to learn a lesson ?".
"Of course, my lord" Spoke Hansa, curious of Yushan's contemplative nature
. Yushan then gently asked one of his friends, Lord Hydarax, the lord of the Water plane, to summon a large mass of water, and shape it to Yushan's will. Hansa was very moved by this display and watched as the shining water curved and bent upon itself and crystallized, and suddenly before the pair was a great, beautiful house, translucent and all filled with light of many colors
“Observe my work,” said Yushan, pleased.
“It is an astounding work,” said Hansa, clearly impressed. They strode inside the house at Yushan’s bidding. The walls were clear and smooth as crystal, and warm to the touch. It had a wide hall, and a full hearth, and was full of light and air, and the openness of the place with the starkness of the void was incredibly pleasing. Hansa would have given half his lordship for such a house, in truth, for his own was a dark and cramped tomb of iron and dust.
“Observe again,” said Yushan, with a keen eye. Hansa did, and as he looked closer, he saw the walls, the floor, the vaulted roof, the wall coverings, and even the altar with the flowers in the visiting hall were all made of water – water as clear and still and solid as smooth and perfect glass.
“Water, lord?” spoke Hansa, sensing some purpose.
“What,” spoke Yushan playfully, “is the meaning of this allegory?”
They reposed for a while as Hansa thought, in the resting hall of that great water house, and gazed through the shining rim of that house across the great void, where the empty sky was perfect in its nothingness. The house rung gently like a bell and it was pleasing to Hansa as he sat in his  flesh and thought.
After a while, he said this:
“The house is a man’s life.”
“Why this?” answered Yushan, as was the fashion.
“Because although it is very beautiful and filled with many fine things, it is only water, after all. It would be poor to rely on its existence –  it is only water pretending to be a house. In truth, there is no real house here at all, just as there is no Hansa, or no plums.”
“This is a good answer,” said Yushan, and made a small motion with his long white fingers, and smiled.
“It is an infuriating answer,” said Hansa, his mood darkening, and his brow furrowing, “As is common with you. How can one grant themselves the pleasure to enjoy such a fine thing? It sparkles and shines like a gorgeous jewel, but its sparkle is an intimate falsehood.”
“Death is my gift to you,” spoke Yushan in reply.
“What’s the point,” spoke Hansa, bitterly,”Of such a fine house, if it is only a lie? What is the point of Hansa, if Hansa is only a lie?”
“I am a fine liar,” spoke Yushan in reply.
Hansa was silent a moment.
“It is a beautiful house,” he admitted, after some time, “It is a beautiful lie.”
“Our self-realization is the most beautiful lie there is. I am the most conceited and prime liar. Lies are the enemy of stagnation and my self-salvation. How could we appreciate the shining beauty of my house of lies,” spoke Yushan, arching his supple back, “if there was always such a house? How could we appreciate Hansa if there was always such a Hansa?”
They sat in stillness a while longer.
“In truth, we would get very bored,” said Hansa, after a while.
“In truth, we would,” said Yushan.


##  IV. The First and Last lesson.

Hansa was of sound mind and proud soul and only once asked Yushan a conceited question, when he was very old and his bones were set about with the dust and bent with age. It was about his own death.
“Lord,” said Hansa, allowing a doubt to blossom, “What is ending?”
It was said later he regretted this question but none could confirm the suspicion.
“Ending is a small light in a vast cavern growing dim,” said Yushan, plainly, as was the manner.
“When the light goes out, what will happen to the cavern?”
“It and the universe will cease to exist, for how can we see anything without any light, no matter how small?” said Yushan. Hansa was somewhat dismayed, but sensed a lesson, as was the manner.
“Darkness is the natural state of caverns,” said he, vexingly, “if I were a cavern, I would be glad to be rid of the pest of light and exist obstinately anyway!”
“Hansa is observant,” said Yushan.
