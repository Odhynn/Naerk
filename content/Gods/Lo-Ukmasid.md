A sovereign archangel that fought numerous times over countless millenia the fiend armies of [[Hell]] and [[Abyss]]. He was respected and honored in [[Fortress of the Just]] as a great strategist and entity of valor. He took part in the [[Unnamed Judgement]] to punish the abuse of the [[Rod of Stone and Steel]] and used his [[Solarium Ring]] to bind and lock the Rod. He fought in [[The Eruption]] with [[Li-Tithlamir]] and defeated the [[Amehan]] army. He killed a titan, and another one with the help of [[Li-Tithlamir]], but she was seriously injured and died soon after. Lo-Ukmasid thought himself personally responsible for her loss and spent several centuries trying to atone.

Upon his death, he was reincarnated into the powerful [[Le-Hara]] celestial emissary.
