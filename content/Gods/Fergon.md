## History

Fergon lived during the time when [[Kultaria]] was first made. His parents had said that when they traveled to it, the [[Dragon of Life]] saved them after an accident. One day as the three of them were traveling for some business, they again saw him blowing his healing breath from afar. The parents were delighted, as they became one of the few people who had seen him twice, but little did they know that they would not live to tell anyone. They were nomadic bandits, who were saved by the Dragon in a battle. However, in a tragic irony, the same nomads attacked and killed Fergon's parents shortly after. Enraged, he picked up a stone and started shouting hatefully "I will kill you". So he did. This act of his was seen and greatly rejoiced by some of the faithful of [[Amehan]], and they pressed upon his wrath for the dragon to convert him.

Very soon they began to travel together in pursuit of [[Nahema]]'s Chosen One. One day, after a relentless hunt, they managed to corner him in a cave. With one of his wings he flung Fergon against a rock and found room to escape. Filled with arrows, javelins and other projectiles, he managed to get away. It was then that he looked back and saw Fergon dying and decided to turn back. The attacks he received until he reached the dying man were many. Then he breathed his last breath on Fergon and died. As soon as the others confirmed that the Dragon was dead they left, not even realizing that Fergon was still breathing.

Since then, Fergon, inspired by the Dragon's sacrifice, became altruistic and began to help everyone, regretting his actions. He kept a bone from the dragon and with the help of a wizard turned it into a mighty scepter, with healing magic stronger than any other. Over the next few years he learned to make the most of it and traveled the world helping others, healing and doing community service. When he died, Nahema welcomed him, but he felt empty. He couldn't stand the idea that there would even be an afterlife without helping others. Then she gave him permission to live in the [[Golden Palace]], where he could help anyone who passed by in need.
