## Realms of Chaos


Too much is known about [[Maeronian]] and his spells, wizards and cities. His brother, however, Lebdegah, is often sidelined. A mysterious creature with unknown purposes, he spent too much time traveling to other dimensions, and even more so to [[Zinctizuctra]], constantly trying to create instability and change, with himself enjoying the process more than anyone.

His philosophy was that of permanent change and absolute chaos. He was the most unpredictable [[Vethian]], and was able to stay one step ahead of his enemies because no one could ever predict his movements. Even other [[Vethians]] failed to rise above him in their structure, no matter how many centuries they had lived together. For Lebdegah, believers are something useless and meaningless: something that limits his absolute freedom and forces him to remain still.

He was always keen about developments in [[Material Plane]], but his travels in other dimensions had piqued his interest. However, after several millennia, the time came for him to deal with [[Naerk]]. And he did this by sending a meteorite from Veth belt onto Na'erk, which crashed into what is now [[Ismaya Bay]] in the year 2125. The damage from the impact was extensive, with tidal waves in many places to the west of [[Naerk]].

The area was soon filled with Vethians. Sometimes friendly, sometimes hostile, and sometimes just plain curious, they occupied the southern islands and built their civilization there: [[Azarradon]], [[Yagalshu]], [[Kleoktra]], [[Ubalnu]], and [[Bluqqa]]. Battles soon broke out from 2129 onwards with [[Drozzin]]'s dragons and [[Bloodscale]]. Four battles were fought, which had mutual losses and succeeded in defining the frontiers of the two rival peoples: the [[Siege of Gorin]], the [[Naval Battle of Girnea]], and the two [[Battles of Khaled-Bal]].

The area centered on the Ismaya Gulf gradually became unrecognizable. The Vethians used all the magic and knowledge they possessed to mutate all of Malahir's creations, living things: Fish became colorful or monstrous, forests turned yellow, animals and birds began to behave strangely. They built cities out of materials unknown, and the inhabitants were just as curious. One city looked like a beehive, another a snake hole, and as in distant [[Xe-Farom]], flying towers and floating houses appeared occasionally, powered by the [[Veth Crystals]] of the meteorite debris that spread across the bay.

[[Malahir]] was very angry at the presence of the Vethians, and even more so at their interference in her creation. The [[Aspects]] became bitter enemies with Ledbegah, and [[Jalerk]] stormed the ocean many times fighting his creatures, in many different places. But the Vethians held out and stayed in their territories, south of Drozzin, and soon their territory was called [[Iazip]], the Realms of Chaos.
