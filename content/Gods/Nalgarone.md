Nalgarone was a renowned architect that worked in [[Zelgerosh]], having arrived there on [[Qurin]]'s mission from [[Imtaria]] during the [[First Zelgerosh Exploration]]. Both the native tribes and the pirates to the south often sought his help to build some of their largest and most imposing buildings. The most important of these were the temples of the [[City of the Sun God]], the Columns of [[Itza]], as well as the underground city of [[Qishiso]].

In reality, Nalgarone, although he seemed kind to everyone and willing to help, had another goal: to make the best creation for himself. Until then, he kept aside the most of the money he was given, and he could make everything they asked of him at half the cost of what others estimated. At the same time, he made the vaults so that they had a back tunnel where he could rob them.

After four decades, he thought he was ready. He had collected a considerable amount of money, while at the same time with his own trusted servants he began to steal from the safes of the towns he built. And then he began to realize his goal: A fortress bigger than any other. He helped Qurin, his friend, build [[Fort Vox|Vox]]. He used a system of arches and wicker bridges at the entrances, and built it on a series of secluded rocks that made it practically impregnable, and was able to ensure that he had his own means of circulation and secret passages. Qurin then left and appointed him the leader of Vox, as he trusted him.

When the clans and pirates realized what had happened, with their vaults empty, and finally located the Vox, it was already impregnable, and Nalgarone had indeed played his cards perfectly. And it is said that even Sergonial was impressed by Nalgarone's feat, and offered him a place in Avernus and the architect continued his work there. Since then, from his towering palaces, Nalgarone represents the ambition that only with absolute power and exploitation can one make the most magnificent works of art.
