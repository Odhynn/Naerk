One of [[Reszek]]'s most loyal servants, Nalshar was a powerful lion-headed outsider. He is Reszek's main general and had a particular hatred for fiends. He was always the first to run to help those in need, and always the last to run away from danger, no matter how great. One such occasion was when he had gone to free captive followers of Reszek from a hidden chasm in the [[Abyss]]. The mission at this point had little chance of success as he wouldn't be able to channel his divine abilities, so he kept it a secret.

When he got there, he broke open all the cells and shouted to the captives to escape through a Gate he created. The demons discovered him and began to attack him in more and more waves. Nalshar, however, held the demonic beings at the edge of a ravine as one by one the captives entered the Gate. As the demons learned what was happening, they began to attack en masse: Even though the captives were able to escape, the demons surrounded him and blocked all avenues of escape. Nalshar lasted for several hours, but at the end of the fifth day he was dying and the demons were endless. All he begged Reszek was not to let the demons pass through the Gate he had opened. Reszek finally realized what was happening and shot a powerful beam of light through the portal. The beam killed all demons in its path and blinded the rest with its glare, except for Nalshar. He took advantage of the respite to crawl to the Gate and leave the Abyss.

Later there are other occasions when he appeared in the [[Mterial Plane]] to help mortals, such as in the retreat of [[Bloodline]] and the [[Zuul's Rampage]]. Nalshar is considered quite a controversial and heretical figure in the Reszek doctrine. Many see him as excessive, others as a necessary evil to the ever-increasing forces of the lower dimensions, others as a hothead with temper issues and others as a hero.
