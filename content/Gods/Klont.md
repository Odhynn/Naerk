The First Smith
Creator of Dwarves
Creator of numerous artifacts, among them [[Equilibrium]], [[Grondharr]], [[Bastion of the Inheritor]], [[The Pitiless Lance]], [[Aegis of 10000 Emperors]], [[Gae Bolg]], [[Zaitan the Nightcaller]], [[Armor of the Nameless Warrior]], [[Viperhide]], [[Aegis of the Storm]], [[Shatterwinds]] during the [[Winter's War]].

## History

When [[Nahema]] was called upon to begin the difficult task of creation, and to materialize the victories of the four [[Elemental Lords]], help was needed. This help came in the form of an unseen primordial being, also known as Thori-Rakkam, Klont. This primordial from [[Kelzadam]], gained the right to exist in the [[Material Plane]] in exchange for carrying out Nahema's commands and helping her to create things of any size and of any material.

Thori was quite active at first, and thoroughly enjoyed every creation he undertook. He used his hammer, the first hammer, to make whatever he was ordered to do. He couldn't and didn't want to stop, so he was constantly taking on something new. However, he gradually lost his strength as the effort to create planets exhausted him. The original colossal being that he was, he soon ended up working at the center of the earth and his height was reduced to a few hundred feet. The gods began to extort orders from him, and he made them, often without anything in return. Soon he ran out of time to make things, and his anvil became his chain. The only thing he probably made of his own volition was when with the help of the other dwarf gods to make the first of their kind.

## [[Winter's War]]

During the [[Winter's War]], [[Tarov]], the root of the mountain, decided that she must bring this being into contact with mortals, to aid them in their battle to contain [[Fallfaunt]]. From the [[Evergrowing Forest]] and the Council of [[Volrek]], a passage opened that led [[Yoll] and [[Ashiro]] to the center of Na'erk, to Thori-Rakkam's forge. The two heroes quickly realized what this creature was and what problems it was facing. So, they decided to make a deal with him.

## The 44 Warrior Sets

Yoll told Thori that they had a solution to the situation he was facing. They would help him return to Kelzadam, a place where he would enjoy his peace, escape his prison, and no one would have the right to disturb him or ask him to fix anything. The gods, since they had all taken sides to end the Winter's War, agreed to release him. In return, he would craft 44 weapons and armor. 40 would be given to the dwarves, to aid them in the coming battle and as a tribute to the dwarven gods to receive him back, while the other four to elite warriors.

Dwarven armor was custom made and worthy of Klont himself. Made of a unique type of brass that came from the Sun, they shone like daylight and tore through the darkness, while combined with the dwarven shields, made of an ancient type of glass, made each wielder a veteran and elite dwarven warrior and moving fort. For weapons he made them axes made of [[Veth]]'s own blood, weapons that shattered the defenses of the Winterwights. Some sets of these weapons and armor, called "[[Grondharr]]" are rumored to still exist in Talhad or Embergrond, but the dwarves keep their secrets well hidden.

The first warrior was [[Prince Valanir]], the beloved son of [[King Sajanu]] of Kultaria. To the prince Thori gave a mighty lance from an ancient time, also known as [[The Pitiless Lance]]. His armor was made from an unknown primal and powerful material became known as the [[Aegis of 1000 Emperors]], and was emblazoned with all the emperors of Kultaria, and whenever an emperor died in the future the armor added his form to its statuary. With it he made the [[Bastion of the Inheritor]], a shield made of Veth's blood, and the [[Gae Bolg]], a sword that later took on the name "Slayer of Legends" because all of its user's enemies began to fear it. Thus, Valanir in battle was a terror to his enemies and a beacon of courage and hope to his warriors.

The second was the [[Raven King]], a race of creatures from the [[Evergrowing Forest]]. Most were negatively prejudiced against him, but he himself was powerful and his contribution to the battle would be decisive, both morally and strategically. So he got his hands on Zaitan, the Nightcaller, a great black sword that devoured souls, and the [[Armor of the Nameless Warrior]], an armor that turned its wearer into a passing shadow, erasing even the memory of his existence. No one at that time could have guessed how those objects would be used in the future, but they would bring much trouble in the centuries to come.

[[Ashiro]]'s armor was called [[Viperhide]], and it was made of an astral, ultralight metal. His sword, with a curved blade, was named [[Equilibrium]]. Its material was a mercury from the time of the Primordial War, when the four [[Elemental Lords]] had joined forces. It could change size and use all four elements at once with each hit, to deadly effect. Weapons worthy of the Elven Hero and Oventhart's fame.

Finally, [[Yoll]] already had in his hands the ancient [[VÃ¥lnir]], the sword of the Valanshore aspect. Instead, as a weapon, he requested three light throwing axes for his daughter, made of the same material as the dwarves' [[Grondharr|shields]] and they were cutting through everything in their path, which they named [[Shatterwinds]]. For his armor he made the [[Aegis of the Storm]], from a piece of the shell of the oldest turtle on Na'erk, as big as an island. A light and practical armor that protected against the elements of nature and the sea.

And so Thorri-Rakam, after twenty days of work, returned permanently to Kelzadam, where he could at last rest among the volcanoes and lava. No one asked him for anything anymore and he was officialy done with the demands of the gods. All the patrons of the plane received him with respect and gratitude, but accepted his desire for solitude.
