## History

When the [[Equalizer]] created [[Nahema]] and [[Amehan]] to intervene on the [[Material Plane]], he was certain he ensured everyone was represented. The material plane was constantly evolving, however, and he soon found that balance was a very delicate concept. Although he was initially sure that no [[primordial]] would be stubborn enough to mess with him, he quickly changed his mind. Not only were some primordials able and willing to do so, since his destruction would not automatically end the material plane, but some, such as [[Fyrlean]] and perhaps [[Yast]], had the power to do so.

The solution to this problem, albeit temporarily, was brought by the creation of Sigard. Sigard as an entity abhorred war and wholeheartedly believed in the prevalence of peace. Against all kinds of violence, he believed that the bloodshed between the various gods and mortals could and should be stopped. To achieve this, he was one of the first to establish the concepts of treaties and contracts, as well as litigation. It is even said that he was among those who attended the [[Unnamed Judgment]].

Sigard was able to significantly curtail hostilities on Na'erk. Some say that he pitched the idea for the [[Dragonpact]] to [[Nentha]], while others say that his followers played a crucial role in the [[Imtaria|Imtarian]] peace treaty prevailing to form [[Palaurim]]. Sigurd found allies in the means of [[Laerion]] and [[Yerastu]], and collaborated with them on various occasions. They made a new dimension, the [[Fortress of the Just]], where all the honest and just souls who defended these ideals in their lives end up. Both gods did not stand idly by: Very quickly their army of extraterrestrials grew, and they were called the [[Valor Guard]].

Many believe that Sigard's existence is one of the reasons the Equalizer no longer deals with [[Naerk]]. Of course, no one knows if he is content with the work his three loyalists are doing or if he fears for his integrity if he appears.
