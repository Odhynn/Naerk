## Synopsis

A wandering healer that lost his faith in his deity after witnessing a great catastrophe, Hansa studied the world under a new prism with the help of his mentor, [[Yushan]]. He was able to see crystal clear the reality as it was and make his own assumptions about the world. He encouraged critical thinking among his students, as well as experimenting, preserving and teaching newfound knowledge.

## Origin Story

Hansa as of today, is the oldest demigod in the entire multiverse. Although he has technically had plenty of opportunity to expand his influence, he himself prefers to remain in his relatively humble position as Patron of scribes and sages of all kinds.

Hansa began life as a mortal, at least that much is known. His past up to a period is quite unclear. He is also known to have been an itinerant missionary, though for reasons of tact he has not revealed to which god he was dedicated. Hansa traveled the country that would later become known as the [[Green Hills]], either preaching or healing anyone in need of his priestly powers. It was a fairly simple and humble life, but his faith gave him purpose.

His life changed when, walking towards the entrance of a valley, he saw a disgusting sight: The remains of a huge battle. It is not clear if he actually saw it or if it was a vision, as no such major conflict has been recorded in that time period. Tens of thousands of corpses adorned the half-burnt plain, half-rotted and with their equipment in such poor condition, he could not distinguish the two sides clearly. The survivors, if there were any, must have been few in order not to bury the bodies of their fellow warriors, or even steal what was of value.

Fighting his horror, Hansa began to search the battlefield for a survivor, someone to save and explain to him what had happened, the reason for such a great conflict. The sun had almost set when the priest finished his survey of the bloodstained valley. The only living things he found were vultures and other scavengers, who had turned the mass slaughter into a buffet. Saddened, disgusted and angry at the extent of the destruction, Hansa prayed to his god for an answer.
_"Why such a waste of life? What is the reason;"_
The answer was quite succinct in his mind: _"I don't know why there is so much violence in the hearts of mortals."_
_"You are good and kind-hearted, you give me strength to remove pain from those who suffer. Why did you allow this disaster to happen?"_
_"As much as I wanted to prevent this from happening, I couldn't help it."_
Hansa, on the verge of tears, responded angrily. _"Then what god are you? Why do I pray to you? Why did I dedicate my life to your name? What is the point of all my labors, if for every life I save, thousands more die in the worst ways?"_
_"I'm sorry, but I don't have an answer to these questions. Only you"_
_"GO AWAY!"_ Hansa screamed, and felt the god's presence leave his mind. He collapsed in the middle of the valley, having renounced both his faith and his mission.

The next day, a ragged beggar also entered the valley, and noticed Hansa sitting in the middle, petrified by rotting corpses, in the same position from the night before. _"What are you sitting there like a dead bastard?"_ asked the beggar, walking up to him _"There are far better places to hang out than the middle of nowhere."_
The former priest didn't even glance at the beggar. _"Leave me alone, stranger."_ she replied dryly.
_"Well done courtesy!"_ The beggar said playfully, scratching his dirty beard. _"I thought you priests knew good manners."_
Hansa looked at him angrily. _"I'm not a priest anymore."_
_"Ah! And for more reason, if I may?"_
Hansa looked at the battlefield sadly. _"The god I served is a hypocrite."_
_"Big words from a man. Be careful not to eat any lightning in your trunk"_
_"I don't care, my life doesn't make much sense anymore."_
_"Well? How so?"_
_"What can a mortal do in the face of the world's violence, if not even a god can intervene in it?"_
The beggar laughed his heart out with these words. _"Ha! Look! You remind me a little of me, but the other way around."_
_"What do you mean;"_
_"You need more strength to understand the world. I, on the other hand, gave up mine for the same reason!"_
Hansa squinted at him. _"What are you? What's your name? You sound crazy but I feel your words have some meaning I don't understand"_
_"My name is Yushan, mortal, and I believe you are on the right track!"_ exclaimed the beggar, and struck his stick on the ground. Suddenly, a golden semi-circular gate opened in front of him _"How about we search for our answers together?"_

Hansa, feeling his desperation leave, followed him through the gate to his palace, into the [[Zinctizuctra|Scream Fields]]. There, he became the former [[Primordial]]'s first student, codifying the knowledge he gained into a book later named The Bible of True Lies (As Yushan himself never found the reason to do such a thing). Chatting with other residents of the Scream Fields, he passed on this knowledge and philosophy of the same, as well as a belief system to Yushan (much to his annoyance, as the last thing he wanted was to deal with such petty matters). These traditions gradually passed on to Na'erk.

When Hansa died, he was already worshiped as Yushan's right-hand man, something unprecedented at the time, and thus posthumously acquired an almost divine status. Yushan, now officially a god, created a demiplane for his student: the Infinite Library. This demiplane is mutually connected to Zinctizuctra and [[Utopia]], as the quest for knowledge reaches all monasteries and holy places. It contains a library of every kind of knowledge of Hansa and his followers, and has properties that bend the very essence of space, making it endless. Hansa spends most of his time there, either writing books himself or arranging them. Nevertheless, there are several reports of the Grand Scribe being present at major events either on Na'erk or in other dimensions, meticulously recording them in one of his massive tomes.
