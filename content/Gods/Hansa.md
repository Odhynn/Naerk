A wandering healer that lost his faith in his deity after witnessing a great catastrophe, Hansa studied the world under a new prism with the help of his mentor, [[Yushan]]. He was able to see crystal clear the reality as it was and make his own assumptions about the world. He encouraged critical thinking among his students, as well as experimenting, preserving and teaching newfound knowledge.
