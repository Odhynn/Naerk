During the creation of the [[Elemental Ring]], there were many dragons scattered across the planes. Many of them wandered aimlessly, both in the [[Material Plane]] and in the rest. They lived only to destroy and terrorize others, blinded by their own egoism and sense of superiority.

One of the first and largest dragons of this category was Klemnestron. He never compromised with any ease from other races, and determined that the path of power is the one by which a dragon proves his worth. Several dragons rallied in his name, and even more after the [[Dragonpact]], which they openly opposed and constantly contested, attacking nearby areas and killing [[Pactkeepers]].

In his name, a Cult was created, the [[Bloodscale]]. This includes a large number of ambitious humanoids who want to gain power quickly. Often they perform rituals with the blood or eggs of dragons that betrayed their kind (mostly those who accept the Dragonpact), and through these the servants gain unnatural power and abilities, from wings to deadly breath and scales. However they are few in number, mostly found in Saltwall, Scalemist and western Tarhelm.
