## Description

Originally one of the strongest [[Vethians]] and one of those that formed [[Zinctizuctra]], Maeronian was at first very subtle. Gradually, it was revealed that he, better than anyone else, could harness the magic of [[Veth]] and sought to increase his influence over [[Naerk]]. Many magicians who defected from their schools were drafted with him, as well as most of those with innate magical abilities, as they were unwanted or even sanctioned in many countries. His servants, based on the [[Veth Spikes]] and [[Iazip]] create unique powerful magical effects, like flying cities, wonderful buildings, effects that defy even time and space and many other magical effects appeared of similar scope.

## History

On a rare [[Astral Alignment]] event at -1039, Maeronian drew power and harnessed it on the material plane from [[Veth Spikes]] with severe consequences. He was imprisoned by [[Yerastu]] for a brief period of time until the Watcher decided he was not the cause of the problem and he asked him to make a pantheon with [[Sumril]] to control magic and its unforseen consequences and limit the spellcasters' power. Maeronian eventually agreed and was freed, and limited intentionally his power and this of his followers, with constant supervision.

Many sages believe that in the next Alignment he plans to break the agreement and repeat his arcane empowerment. With his status now as the main god of magic, it is very likely that this new attempt will have a stronger effect than the last time, which could mean that all control over magic is lost and everyone uses it against will without any limit with what this entails, to the creation of massive explosions, time jumps, distortions in the earth and certain destruction.
