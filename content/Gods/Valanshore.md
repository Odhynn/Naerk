A deer-shaped entity that promotes fair sportsmanship, young innosence and passion in life. Her known avatar, the white deer [[Valanfaul]], roams [[Fervolosh]] trees and provides guidance and healing to those in need. During the events of [[e-antizelia-tou-elaphiou-tes-alepous-kai-tou-gerakiou|a ritual]] in [[Korhond]], she argued and reconciled with [[Berohath]] and [[B'tolen]].
