In [[Arbader]], two millennia ago, there lived a humble peasant, also known as Condall. He had lost his job in a mine because he broke his arm and leg in a fall, and had been wandering the country aimlessly ever since. He couldn't find a job since he was disabled, so he quickly turned to begging. He wandered from place to place with a limp, collected stories, transmitted them, sang and gradually gained fame.

The story goes that [[Factar]] one day passed a crossroad where Condall was begging and offered to heal him so he could find work. But Condall refused, because he thought he deserved what he had suffered as he liked the life he was leading and did not want to go back to the mine. The god then, respecting his choice, gave him a memory to retain stories and a voice to tell them. And Condall became known as the wandering troubadour who traveled from [[Northern Darrok]] to [[Oromil]] and carried songs and stories everywhere. He is the patron of poets, writers and musicians, as well as travelers and scholars.
