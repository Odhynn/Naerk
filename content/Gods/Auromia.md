## STORY

Auromia was an ambitious leader of a group of [[Primordial|Primordials]] that tried to find a gap in the material world. This was a soul, and through the spiritual dimension, she made her domain, the [[Ethereal Plane]], coexisting with the [[Material Plane]]. However, Auromia, trying to trick others and increase her influence, made an attempt to gain power on the material plane as well, in the [[Qusm]] area. But she could not take material form, as a spiritual being, and as a result she was disintegrated as soon as she made the passing, and her power spread throughout the moon, creating various supernatural effects on it, among them the ethereal plane, which extends everywhere.

## LEGACY

Of the 5 Primordials who served her, [[Malahir]] was the only one who understood her plans in time, and she fled to the [[Elemental Lords]], who both accepted and protected her. The remaining four ([[Sumril]], [[Voolthow]], [[Yast]] and [[Hozetul]] created their own dimensions in the background of the fifth.
