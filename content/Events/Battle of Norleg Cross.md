Gert was an ice giant who realized that he could rob [[Korhond]] of its riches. He hid his movements from [[Skalindrosh]] and moved west.

The Fosh clan were surprised to find one morning that an army of hundreds of giants had camped outside [[Norleg]] crossing and were preparing to attack them. Archer divisions were sent to deal with them. Their first shots laid down five giants, but they responded by hurling huge chunks of glacier that melted anyone in their elliptical path and quickly scattered the defensive line. The giants charged into the village in order, and then Rakof in his desperation found a rune Dalvuigg had left for him to communicate with and activated it, clutching it to his chest.

[[Dalvuigg]] became aware of the incident and teleported to Rakof's house. When he realized what was happening, he appeared before the giants and demanded that they stop. Gert, despite his violent instincts, could not disobey Skalindrosh's counselor, and was forced to stop his warriors. However, he also had the right to call for a duel, to enforce his will. Gert knew that sacking the city was worth the small risk that Skalindrosh would be displeased with him: And that was because Dalvuigg, though a meter taller, was not a warrior in his eyes, but a scholar, and he believed that he would easily take him out of the way.

Dalvuigg realized that with all of Gert's army supporting him, he could not refuse the duel, and he felt obliged to the townsfolk. But he hoped that his soldiers could accept his authority if he won, and stop further bloodshed. The people of Osf√•n sent the civilian population away from the city and created a defensive cordon around it, worried about the outcome, while the giants gathered to watch the duel.

In giant duels, everything is allowed: Magic and tradition, all must be accepted. The rules were established in ancient times and all giants must respect them. So Dalvuigg drew a knife and began to invoke his magic, while Gert, armed, charged at him with his spear. A circle of runes had formed on the ground around the word, forming an igloo. Gert with a few blows broke the ice, but inside Dalvuigg had managed to transform into a huge mammoth with carved tusks.

He attacked the beast with his spear, which had an icy tip. Dalvuigg parried a few blows with his tusks, but more and more were coming at him. Unlike Gert, he was not immune to cold, and his movements gradually became slower and stiffer. With his trunk he jabbed at the warrior from time to time, but he was wearing armor and could not do him much damage. Whenever he tried to grab him with his tusks, Gert impaled him with his spear and forced him to let go.

Exhausted, Dalvuigg returned to his form. Gert began to strike him with his spear, and with the knife the scholar was even more unable to parry. He shouted a command, and a beam of light fell on Gert and burned his face, blinding him. Buying time, he gathered his strength to circle around Gert, who was thrashing blindly back and forth, furious. It formed runes, which coalesced to create lava, which was thrown at Gert. When he found out Dalvuigg's location he struck him in the leg with his spear, impaling him. They both knew they had to hurry. Dalvuigg was the first to move. He summoned a storm of freezing hail that fell on Gert. He remained unharmed, but the lava on him petrified and immobilized him. He fell down helpless, and after a while he admitted defeat.

The village warriors approached in relief, knowing they had been saved. Dalvuigg treated his wound with magic, and then ordered [[Gert]] to leave there permanently and not return, except in peace. As compensation for the damage they did, Gert should each year choose thirty of his warriors, and send them into the service of the Fosh, to help them in any way they want. Gert swallowed his pride and walked away defeated.
