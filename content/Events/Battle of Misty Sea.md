## Background

When five [[Imtaria]]n ships were lost after a supposed storm, a large fleet of [[Palaurim]] ships arrived at the northern [[Misty Sea]] to investigate. Noone could believe that this was an accident, as [[Kambah]] has started to increase its influence in the region. That's why the fleet came in force, boasting four hundred galleons. At the spot, they found eight hundred, almost twice, Kambah ships waiting for them. Up front was [[Rongerak]]'s ship. Admiral [[Naroth]] and the Emperor's envoy [[Lestan]], came in peace to meet him and discuss about the fate of the ships. In a [[Breaking of the Treaty|conversation that turned into a betrayal]], [[Lestan]] and his guards were slaughtered and [[Naroth]] barely managed to escape.

## Attack

The admiral soon faced a hard truth. Imtaria's naval force had clearly dwindled and it was the first time that Kambah had assembled such a large fleet. In the engagement one hundred and forty-one [[Palaurim]] ships were sunk and nearly half of them within the first half hour. Losses to sailors exceeded eight thousand. The orcs of Kambah rained down flaming missiles and stones from the ships' catapults and at the same time they started ramming the nearest warships with fast boats. The defense that Admiral Naroth developed with his magic was able to partially limit the total destruction, but the result was decided.

## Aftermath

It was now apparent that as great a military power as Imtaria was, it was no longer invincible. Their coral ships, help from water elementals, [[Urdankh]] helmsmen and oarsmen, all these were not enough in the face of a superior strategic plan, a surprise attack and a determined army. And above all, with a particularly charismatic leader leading the attack, Rongerak. Imtaria's heyday was over, and its sunken ships were the most shocking evidence. The age when the army and its strength alone were sufficient for victory had passed. Today's generals had to have strategic skills instead of arrogance. And that didn't exist.

Naroth knew this situation would only get worse. The [[Emperor Rokfilar III|emperor]], as wise as he was, was surrounded by a cabal of nobles who had led Imtaria into utter decline. These wealthy families had acquired many privileges, and had begun to corrupt the system of administration within the empire. They appointed their own persons, confident for their portfolio but completely incompetent. Until now they had no reason to face an army as strong as Rongerak's, but the admiral understood that the threat of Kambah required radical changes in the command system to deal with it. Otherwise, all the countries of Palaurim were threatened.

Even worse, the land army was not in much better shape. The Eastern Expeditionary Force had suffered a severe [[Battle of the Gap|defeat]] at Paraselt. A defeat that cost nearly five thousand soldiers, more than a tenth of the Frontier Battalion. Even worse, several natives of the Green Hills had died, causing many residents to view Imtaria with concern. Early reports said that goblins and Black Vultures from Paraselt had attacked. The first hypothesis was that one of the leaders of the [[Defeated Army]] was alive. Now, it didn't look so defeated, and that leader had probably contacted Rongerak. If they had allied together, then the danger to Palaurim would be even greater.
