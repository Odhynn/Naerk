After the naval battle of the Mist, the masks fell. Imtaria's naval power had clearly dwindled, and it was the first time that Kamba had assembled such a large fleet. In the engagement one hundred and forty-one ships were sunk, and nearly half of them within the first half hour. Losses to sailors exceeded eight thousand. The orcs of Kamba rained down flaming missiles and stones from the ships' catapults, while at the same time ramming the nearest warships with fast boats. The defense that Admiral Naroth developed with his magic was able to partially limit the total destruction, but the result was decided.
It was now apparent that as great a fighting force as Imtaria was, she was no longer invincible. Their coral ships, help from water elementals, Urdankh helmsmen and oarsmen, all these were not enough in the face of a superior strategic plan, a surprise attack and a determined army. And above all, with a particularly charismatic leader, Rongerak. Imtaria's heyday was over, and her sunken ships were the most shocking evidence. The period when the army and its strength alone were sufficient for victory had passed. Today's generals had to have strategy, in addition to arrogance. And that didn't exist.
Naroth knew this situation would only get worse. The emperor, as intelligent as he was, was surrounded by a cabal of nobles who had led Imtaria into utter decline. These wealthy families had acquired many privileges, and had begun to corrupt the system of administration within the territory. They appointed their own persons, confident in their purposes but completely incompetent. Until now they had not had to deal with an army as strong as Rongerak's, but the admiral understood that the threat of Kambah required radical changes in the command system to deal with it. Otherwise, all the countries of Palaurim were threatened.
Even worse, the land body was not in much better shape. The Eastern Expeditionary Force had suffered a severe defeat at Paraselt. A defeat that cost nearly five thousand soldiers, more than a tenth of the Frontier Battalion. Even worse, several natives of the Green Hills had died, causing many residents to view Imtaria with concern.
Early reports said that goblins and Black Vultures from Paraselt had attacked. The first hypothesis was that one of the leaders of the Defeated army was alive. Now, she didn't look so defeated, and that leader had probably contacted Rongerak. If they had allied themselves, then the danger to Palaurim would be even greater.
Apparently Naroth wasn't ready to lay down his arms. He had to take action, and he had many ideas in mind. However, he knew in his heart that he would take on his duties with much more joy if he saw the values of justice and peace, which defined him and his own country, represented in the faces and decisions of the high officials and the emperor. Instead, he saw greed, laziness and indifference. And he knew that this alone could bring disaster.
