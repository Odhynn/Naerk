In the year 4817, in the [[Arbader]] capital of [[Hashnev]], a series of highly controversial and unusual events took place. Hashnev had been chosen as the place where the [[Palaurim]] conference would take place for three weeks. At the heart of the conversation were the military failures, both the [[Battle of Misty Sea]] and the [[Battle of the Gap|crushing defeat]] at Paraselt by the ironically, "[[Defeated Army]]". The discussion took place with much fanfare and in the absence of Palaurim's admiral, [[Naroth]] of [[Urdankh]].

In those circumstances, no one wanted to take the responsibilities assigned to him. The generals were pointing fingers at each other, while [[Whistor]] and [[Oromil]] threatened to stop supplying the army if they couldn't get results. The introversion of the conversation was blocked by certain people, mainly Counselors from [[Zolkar]], [[Urdankh]] and [[Oromil]]. Of course, this process was not easy at all, and no one was punished for these failures, but at least a plan could be implemented which would shield the countries to the north and east from future attacks.

Admiral Naroth returned on the last day of the council. He laid the blame on various generals and commissars, accusing the [[Arbader]] [[King Oodas]] of trying to assassinate him, of sabotaging the fleet, and of being late because he was hiding from his assassins. King Oodas defended himself by saying that it was signed by a secretary of his who had deposed him because he considered him suspicious. But this incident did not seem so disconnected from a series of others.

Meanwhile, in [[Hashnev]] at that time two powerful groups of assassins were clashing underground: the [[Crimson Steel]] and the [[Order of the Cave]]. The latter were even considered suspects for the attempt to kill Naroth. At the same time, assassination attempts were being made on other Counselors who expressed a more heretical view on the Palaurim council. And in the midst of it all, the abolition of slavery in the Palaurim lands was proposed by [[Zolkar]] Counselors of [[Berenfaer]], a position that passed, as the slavery circles operated in the dark and were not legitimized by most, while no one wanted to openly admit that slavery was acceptable.

Already, many were sharpening their swords and ready to slaughter each other, but two more events generalized uncertainty in the city. The first was the assassination of Sergonial's high priest, [[Alkar the Black]], and his replacement by [[Ternath]] Inkblood, a priest and lawyer who was to propose many reforms and also held a position on the council. He strengthened the power of the temple and purged various spies who were working with the king and the Order of the Cave. Afterwards, Ternath was appointed Counsellor of Hashnev with the authority to put an end to the chaos in the city, as well as to meet some of Arbader's tax obligations.

The second was that Prince [[Marlyk]] Withaz, the son of the murdered [[King Laorwick II]], had returned to the city and wanted revenge. In his endeavor, he found various allies, admirers of the old king, while he even managed to stage his death to reduce suspicions. He did not wish to move while Palaurim's forces were in the city, however, so he set the day after Palaurim's departure as the day to carry out his plans.

The councils of Palaurim were concluded and the critical day came. The prince with a small unit attacked from a secret passage in the palace, while a second group entered through the tower. A third group took it upon themselves to open the gates up to the palace for all the remaining rebels to enter. The first gate was opened, the rebels after a battle entered the courtyard, while the guards seemed unprepared.

But the plan failed. The king was probably not in the palace, as he had been informed of the attack. Instead, there was a large force of priests, wizards, golems, and guards awaiting the prince's force, who upon reaching the throne room was surrounded on all sides and slaughtered. Archers and magicians also appeared in the courtyard and fired arrows and spells from above, killing the hundred or so rebels, while it is rumored that no one survived the massacre. The rumors that have come out are of all kinds, and no one can say with certainty the truth: that vampires and assassins were in the king's place, that Sergonial's priests attacked the rebels, and that the king himself was in reality a different person disguised as him. Others said they had seen dozens of Bugbears on the rooftops watching from afar, while others said Cyclops were involved in the rebellion.

The next day in the city, [[King Oodas]] annulled the death of Prince [[Marlyk]], and the failed rebellion against him. At his side was [[Ternath]] the high priest, while the king reported strengthening the guard and patrols in the city and with forces from Sergonial's temple. In the following months, crime in Hashnev decreased considerably, following various restructurings in the legal system. At the same time, the [[O]]rder of the Cave]] probably limited its activity in the city, for unknown reasons. And thus ended a period of instability in the city.
