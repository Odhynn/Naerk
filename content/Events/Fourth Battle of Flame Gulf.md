After a brief victory at the [[Third Battle of Flame Gulf]], the [[Hoarinhel]] navy reached [[Dzultar]] port to find a few ships ready to defend the city. They attacked, but eventually a naval force from Erstal arrived, so that the Sultan's fleet could not be refuted. After three days, the [[Dzultar]] main navy returned to break the siege, in a battle that had huge mutual losses, slightly favoring the now retreating Sultan forces. After that, an unstable treaty was signed in [[Floweroot]] and hostilities were seased.
