## the Grand Alliance

After [[Imtaria]] was  established, the Emperors' first goal was to immediately restore the country's economy after the [[Brother's War]]. To do this, he first finalized mutual trust relationships with the water creatures on the [[Urdankh]] Peninsula. Then, he invited many neighboring countries to conclude a treaty of free movement of goods. Of these, four responded to the call, seeing it in their best interest to cease hostilities and develop trade. Thus Palaurim was defined and signed by all:

[[Green Hills]]
[[Oromil]]
[[Whistor]]
[[Arbader]] 

Five years later, [[Zolkar]] joined.
At year 4580, 

In these countries the treaty defined the free movement of merchandise and goods. Responsible for maintaining order was Imtaria's army throughout the land and in each country its corresponding fighting force. Thus each country had economic gain and protection, but at the same time Imtaria could also expand and trade throughout this territory without disturbance. The agreement also included laws on how the caravans and ships would move and what routes they would choose, while at the same time it set the exchange rate for the merchants. The coins were minted in three cities in Imtaria ([[Vaedar]], [[Syvorms]] and [[Faankar]]) and the capitals of the other four countries, and all bore Palaurim's signature. In order of value:

-The triangular **copper coins** with the hole, for a loaf of bread, where ten are equal to one silver.
-The square **silver coins**, for a truckle of cheese, where ten are equal to one gold.
-The round **gold coins**, for a goat. It is the basic unit of measurement, where ten is equal to one platinum.
-The rectangular **platinum coins**, for a cow.

Besides these, the exchange rate of other currencies used by other cultures was set:

**Iron coin**: Pitch black and elliptical, western seas, equal to 5 silver coins.
**Dragon coin**: Round and red, Kambah, equal to 5 platinum coins.
**Topaz coin**: Hollow hexagon, equal to 100 platinum coins.

The countries of Palaurim hold a council every year, usually on the 10th of Flowergrow, which is also the anniversary of its founding. In addition, emergency councils are held in case of war, threat or unforeseen events. The council is usually held in [[Arbader]] or Imtaria, and is attended by commissioners from the corresponding countries, depending on their size, population and economic power. Currently, the council had 95 councilors: 28 from Oromil, 22 from Imtaria, 15 from the Green Hills, 13 from Arbader, 10 from South Darrok, 3 from Urdankh, 2 from Whistor, and 2 from Zolkar. Simple decisions are usually taken by a relative majority, while the most important ones are taken by an absolute majority, while each country has the right to choose in any way it wants who will be the commissioners who will fill the positions corresponding to it.
