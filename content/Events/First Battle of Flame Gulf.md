When the Sultan forced an embargo on [[Dzultar]], as they refused to pay his taxes for a second year, Dzultar attacked his navy. The attack was unexpected, but the [[Hoarinhel]] fleet had large galleys equipped with three balista each who threw flaming javelins, as well as assistance from mages. The Dzultar fleet, on the other hand, had from commercial schooners to fishermen sloops. But they were at least three times in number, and due to the slack administration, it was difficult to communicate that the losses were high and they had to retreat. Dzultar warriors rushed on the ships, and after a fierce battle they managed to control fifteen galleys. The rest, as they were outnumbered, were forced to retreat, in a bloody escape with several local casualties.

Although this defeat was not decisive, the Sultan's reputation as [[Markesh]]'s largest naval force had irreparably suffered. He gathered his fleet and forced the [[Second Battle of Flame Gulf]].
