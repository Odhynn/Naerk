## Description

Abyszmor is a demonic viral affliction seemingly evolved from the common [[demon]] fever, prevalent in southeastern [[Olgizmar]]. Over the decades, it has grown resistant to magic treatment, whether by virtue of its own abyss-paced evolution or by careful engineering by the demons. Sometimes it can be contacted by the infamous [[Blood Rain]]. Weaker instances may be found in northwest Olgizmar, as the disease is much weaker in regions devoid of demonic presence, making recuperation there more likely even for infections that occurred in demonic holdings. Long-term residents in both areas have developed resistances to their localised strands, though the disease remains hazardously contagious for outsiders. The disease is particularly difficult to remove using magic.

## Early Stage

Portions of the victim's skin peel away as he suffers fatigue and exhaustion.

## Moderate Stage

The victim begins to grow paranoid, and is prone to increasingly realistic hallucinations. Loss of fingernails and severe nausea.

## Severe Stage

Unable to walk. Loss of teeth and hair.

## Terminal Stage

The victim is rendered bedridden and can converse, but can’t stand on its own. Complete limb loss or gaping wounds in the hours before death. Death soon follows. The corpse is still contagious.

Beyond Olgizmar’s abyssal lands, the disease is much less virulent and isn't contagious.
