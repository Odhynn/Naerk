## Background

The [[Demon Archlords]] weren't always three. When they escaped from [[Yerastu]]'s rule, there were many who were of comparable strength to the survivors today, numbering over twenty. However, the alliance and balance between them was not to last long.

The [[Abyss]] was created by five archdemons, however they had external help. Seeing their escape from Yerastu's service, [[Amehan]] approached them secretly and offered his help. Apparently, his profit was great: he was able to help those who turned to him create the Abyss, but they had to swear absolute submission to him: they too were called the Chosen. The rest of the demon lords, when they saw that their brothers had made a new dimension, did not bother with the details, and indeed the resulting [[Eternal Slaughter|battle]] with [[Sergonial]] kept them busy for a long time. Amehan was also helping them in the battle, for he saw the demons as his best hope to create instability and peril in [[Naerk]] and [[Styx]].

However, the situation changed as soon as the [[Eternal Slaughter]] ended. Amehan now had other places to turn to further his agenda: Sergonial's army, individual warlords like [[Karadosh]], and even [[Yast]], whom he had begun to approach and gradually his influence grew, while various [[Vethians]], [[Vulga]] and [[Erevi]] began to serve him in [[Tartara]]. He was no longer forced to rely on the [[demons]], and began to underestimate them and lessen the help he gave them. The demons, at the same time, found that his five subordinates were very conservative and did not took their own initiatives, since they obeyed Amehan. Thus, the thirteen demons who had survived the Eternal Slaughter conspired and attacked the Chosen Ones.

## Events

The result was a second round of bloodshed, which became known as the Demonic Civil War. The losses were huge on both sides, and many sages argue that this battle changed the entire Abyss, and if carried on the demons would all die by their own kin. Even though the Conspirators were outnumbering the Chosen, the second faction was much stronger and had the help of Amehan, while many of their subordinates were afraid to betray them. Some say that the only one who saw the disaster coming was [[Xeurim]]: But even she, due to her nature, waited for the strongest demons to slaughter each other before taking the initiative to stop them, in order to ensure that she would obtain one of the most important positions in the new hierarchy that was being formed.

Some Conspirators consciously chose to run away in order to escape, and two of them were executed by the Chosen. Of the five Chosen, only two ultimately lived: Disiklek and [[Skaularame]]. The second exiled himself and renounced all the power he held, and the first, who was the most timid, with the intervention of Xeurim stopped the battle with [[Otynhash]] and the three of them undertook the rebuilding of the Abyss. They consciously chose not to make any of the three superior to the other two, to avoid future bloodshed, and despite the occasional power struggles, they largely succeeded. Disiklek maintained a little contact with Amehan, but now the latter does not exercise authority over him. Of the Conspirators, in addition to the two lords, two others have survived: [[Kersil]] and [[Sintagast]], who are lost in the underworld along with Skaularame.
