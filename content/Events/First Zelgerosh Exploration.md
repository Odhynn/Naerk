In [[Imtaria]], they had known since the [[Winter's War]] that there was a continent southeast of [[Whistor]]. No one had traveled there, and with the [[Brother's War|civil war within the empire]], no one had the luxury of dealing with it. However, once the situation in the newly founded empire stabilized, there were many who began to wonder what was there and wanted to explore.

The first research expedition, with five ships, set out from [[Oscia]] with a stop in Whistor for supplies. The leader of this expedition was Qurin, Baron of [[Faankar]] and loyal to [[Sigard]], who was a distant descendant of [[Prince Valanir]]. He had taken with him various explorers, cartographers and geographers of [[Syvorms Chartographic Society]], as well as several soldiers. Among them were the cartographer [[Ravyn]], the architect [[Nalgarone]] and General Duarte. Each of them was to play a crucial role in the rest of the exploration.

Avoiding the infamous Devi Strait, Qurin headed east. The Haltu Desert did not seem like a good place to land, so he continued until the terrain became more fertile and moist, and there, next to the Ayui River, he founded Qurin, the eponymous city. With access to water, scarce raw materials, and fertile enough land to support farms, Qurin quickly grew into a small city, with fortifications and a central trading post, leading to the start of the Southern Trade Route that carried goods to and from Imtaria with stops at Whistor and Markesh.

Next stop was the city of Itza, where the first, violent contact with natives came. However, with the intervention of Nalgarone and Ravyn, the hostilities stopped and they agreed with the local lizardfolk to exchange metals and tools for precious stones and forest fruits. Nalgarone then began to show them various architectural and mechanical skills that he knew, which made the Tixali respect and trust him. Nalgarone later used this for his own purposes, but at first he built them incredible buildings and temples, unique in style and dimensions, while also fitting in with the customs and traditions of the region. Thus, the architect settled there.

Finding the Itza a good, albeit temporary, ally, Qurin and his group continued south, but then disagreements with General Duarte began. Duarte said they should explore the interior, but Qurin did not want to break the informal peace with the Tixali, and even more so did not want a repeat of the bloodshed on the Itza coast, for which Duarte was primarily responsible. Qurin instead sent Ravyn with a small team to begin mapping the interior, with orders to respect the locals. They established a second coastal base, east of the Sumshirlu swamps, which became General Duarte's headquarters.

Qurin decided to continue south with three ships, wanting to explore the unknown. He sailed west, to see the wild side of the island, until at the mouth of the Wungu River exhaustion and lack of food forced them to stop. There Qurin founded his last city: Vox, in the center of which a temple dedicated to Sigard was created and flanked by a powerful fortress, which was said to be impossible to besiege. The plans were taken on by Nalgarone, and it is said to have been his most impressive work.

Wanting to return to Imtaria, the following year, Qurin found himself alone. Half the crew wanted to stay there, enjoying their new life, as a result of which only two ships returned. General Duarte expelled Qurin from his city, refusing any cooperation with Imtaria, and soon became a pirate and began to plunder the trade route, while his city was named Plunder Town and is the precursor to the Pirate Council.

In Vox, Qurin found Nalgarone had betrayed him and robbed the natives, who said that he had used magic and that the fortress was cursed. As for Ravyn, he sent him maps from time to time, but the work he had undertaken seemed to have no end. So, he returned to Emperor Khalaris what he learned and brought him treasures from the south. Imtaria's interest in Zelgerosh became very great, and the South Trade Route now counted dozens of ships every week. Qurin continued his missions in Zelgerosh, until after a severe marsh disease he died in St. Qurin, where he was declared a saint posthumously.
