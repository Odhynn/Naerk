## Background

The feud of the four ruling families in [[Fellgaunt]], Tulenkar, Merydra, Meacel and Kalistrom, eventualy escellated as the Kalistroms secretly started trading slaves and there were suspicions that [[Tarlosh Kalistrom]], the new councelor had begun to create undead, but no one could prove it. until the day the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]] arrived in town. The first to realize their threat was Tarlosh himself, where he trapped them in a dungeon full of huge fleshy undead. When the Tulenkar understood his whole scemes, fights broke out between the two houses in the streets of the city. Very quickly the fighting escalated, with most civilians fleeing the city, the Merydra supporting the Kalistroms and the few Meacels who remained supporting the Tulenkar.

## Battle

With the Kalistrom forces greatly outnumbered, and supported by undead that now roamed the city streets freely, the skirmishes were quickly focused to a siege of the Tulenkar castle. A guild of halflings as well as the Band allied themselves with the Tulenkar and fought against the other two houses. The Tulenkar barely numbered more than seven hundred, with the Kalistrom numbering nearly five thousand with the undead.

The siege that developed was ambiguous, and was decided by small but critical factors. Among these were Captain [[Geraldor]]'s strategic plan, the team's contribution, as well as acts of incredible courage by the likes of [[Domosan]], [[Voldrak]], [[Rotting]], [[Enrick]], and the Tulenkar leader himself, [[Gathclan Tulenkar|Gathclan]]. Despite their initial losses amounting to nearly a fifth of the army, the Kalistroms took the wall once the necromancer joined the fray, but the retreat to the Tulenkar tower was orderly and casualties were light.

After a day of fruitless siege, reinforcements came in the most unexpected way. First the dragon [[Haldisoir]], took the opportunity to aid [[Droghor]] and wreak havoc undisturbed, and then a massive earth Elemental, [[Bisdir]], and a ruby Golem, which the team found and recruited into the city's defense, while rumor has it that even a [[Salkor|Vethian]] meddled. Their counterattack broke the Kalistrom lines, while the necromancer was said to have been killed by the Golem.

## Aftermath

After the battle, the Tulenkars rule the city and rebuilt it. Peace was restored in the city, although [[Voldrak]] left and gathered nomad followers that started pillaging the plains for several years.
