[[Otynhash]] gathered his warriors and attacked [[Tarthyn]] to test the resolve of his subjects. The elves, humans and druids of the area were caught off guard by the sudden advance of the demonic army. Forests burned, houses were destroyed, and the army seemed unstoppable.

However, Tarthyn's forces soon gathered, and awaited Otynhash's army at Lake [[Tartha]]. The demonic army charged straight at Tarthyn's defenses, and received a cloud of arrows, while horsemen and wild bears and dire badgers surrounded them. Carnage ensued, as those who came to hand-to-hand combat with Otynhash's first demonic minotaurs and beasts fell dead, but their losses were immense. In the end, only a small group was able to break the Tarthyn cordon to the south and escape the slaughter, to nowadats [[Ixion]] labyrinth.
