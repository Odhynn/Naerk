After several goblin raids to [[Green Hills]], [[Imtaria]]n forces recruited thousands of locals to a campaign against the [[Defeated Army]], to end their threat once and for all. Their forces were ill-trained and equipped for the most part, and the march to southeast was difficult. Goblin scouts had learned their positions and organised a surprise attack in their temporary encampment. An overwhelming force of wargs and goblins attacked suddenly, with little time for the defenders to prepare. At the same time, giant Black Vultures carrying barbed logs in pairs swooped from the sky and let their deadly weapons fall upon the flat-footed warriors of [[Palaurim]]. The Imtarian generals tried to organize a defence but the vast majority of the army panicked and fled. Slaughter ensued, as those left behind were butchered and the few organized pockets of resistance were eventually surrounded by armored trolls. Those lucky were killed on the spot, while many of them were tortured to death, even those that surrendered. The goblins took revenge for the death of [[Gorbla]], 59 years ago.
