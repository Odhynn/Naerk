## Summoning Attempt

One day, the [[Demonslaver]] Anthis had arranged a demonstration for other archmages of the [[Demonslavers]] and they had gathered at [[Pyrlon]]'s summoning tower. Properly prepared, Anthis opened a great [[Portal]] to the Abyss, through which Knaridzna passed, who bowed to the haughty mages, who were impressed with the demonic general's power. Their surprise was even greater when another serpentine form emerged from the gate, a powerful demoness brandishing jatagans and shields in her six arms. Then an older mage, [[Lodern]], turned to Anthis and asked if the situation was under control.

## Summoning goes South

The answer came both from Anthis's bewilderment, not expecting another to appear, and from a third, flaming figure appearing at the Gate. The result was beyond Anthis's expectations, precisely because the demons had tricked him and used his own spells to get through the gate and break through the arrogant mage's protections. Lodern was the only mage who managed to teleport away, as he had left his arcane mark for safety reasons: The others watched in awe as Knaridzna slammed his lance down and a field appeared that momentarily broke the concentration of those mages who began chanting spells.

## Chaos in the Portal Site

Chaos ensued. Helpless, the wizards watched the demons tear them apart. Anthis tried to negate and close his Gate but with a Power Word from the flaming demon he was frozen in place watching his colleagues being slaughtered. More demons continued to pass through the gate, and soon the best of Pyrlon's wizards had been slaughtered. Only two remained alive beyond Anthis: An elven sorceress named [[Kervyl]], and an archmage, [[Releston]]. Kervyl, who loathed Anthis had come to the show having cast all the defensive spells she knew, while Releston had transformed into a dragon and began trading blows with the serpentine demoness. Very quickly they surrounded him, as soon as they finished with the rest, but he was able to fly away and save himself.

Kervyl was the last. She shot bolts of lightning from her hands and roasted the first demon that reached her alive, but the rest blocked her every possible way of escape. They began pounding her with claws and swords, but to no avail. After a while she got tired and when [[Knaritzna]] fell on her, he knocked her down and immobilized her. The demons then hung her on the walls and began to torture her. The gate had been left open and there was no one to close it. Soon, hordes of demons had arrived, and they began to spread throughout [[Pyrlon]], which without its strongest mages was a feast for the insatiable jaws of the [[Abyss]].

## Slaughter on the Streets

Within an hour Pyrlon's fate was sealed. The city was filled with demons and its streets were stained with blood. Sorcerers were the first target: Any resident who appeared to cast a spell was instantly targeted by hordes of demons. Initially in some alleys and towers the [[Demonslavers]] tried to put together some defenses, but when huge horned demons broke down the doors and entered, the defense plans fell apart. Soon each mage began to look to their survival and salvage what they could of their belongings. Those who could teleport did so without a second thought: Most of those left behind used illusions to hide and escape, save for a few who decided to fall into battle. Most were selfish enough to not risk their lives for a colleague, and thus the defense soon collapsed.

The streets of the city were painted red as the destruction and carnage exceeded all limits. Each demon that appeared had a different way of satisfying his desires: One slaughtered wizards and impaled them on his spear, another stole babies and burned them, another collected slaves to sell, and another painted poems in her language with the entrails of the dead. Many residents fainted or froze in terror before the inhuman images of horror they saw. The demon army that had been unleashed was accountable to no one and after millennia in the Abyss could do whatever it wanted unhindered. The [[Sages of the North]] refer to it as the most barbaric and brutal act in [[Naerk]] history.

The destruction of the city lasted five days, at the end of which nothing resembled its original form. Half the wizard towers had fallen, many houses were smoking blackened, and the dead had piled up in the squares and alleys, while the wizards had been hung ostentatiously on the highest points of the city, butchered in plain sight. The quarters around the gate had taken on a dark red color, as beyond the demons essence had begun to flow into [[Olgizmar]] from the [[Abyss]] itself. Fiendish veins had hugged the walls like vines and had begun to feed on the corpses of the dead, strengthening the influence of the Abyss.
