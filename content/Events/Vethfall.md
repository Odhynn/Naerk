In the winter of the year 4817, at the end of Graymist, a shocking event came to change [[Naerk]] radically: the Vethfall. Some will say that it is solely due to the actions of a small group of fanatical priests and loyal extraplanar entities, but the reality goes back many millennia: At the time in [[Merkal]] there was the city of Mi-Solla, the city of music. The city had a guardian angel, also known as [[Chun'm]], and it became famous everywhere for its music, but this was also the reason for the city's downfall. At the same time, in the northwest, [[Drakainia]], an otherworldly and powerful entity, appeared. A being of immense power summoned by dr. [[Vivec]], a powerful alchemist who began experimenting on her and charging her with positive energy in a specially constructed demiplane. However this drove her completely crazy and Vivec lost control.

Drakainia broke her prison and soon proved to be a threat to the entire [[Material Plane]]. She began to gather an army of followers, the Sect of the Great Mother, to her cause who served her blindly. She began to wreak havoc and was a threat to Mi-Solla as well. [[Chun'm]] went to fight her and managed to put her back in her prison. However, he was too weak from the effort and fell into a lethargy.

A group of Drakainia loyalists left after the battle tried to bring her back. However, they soon found that the only way was to use the same power Angel used to imprison her: The same bell. They tried to create the right conditions to push enough energy through it to release it. And this happened in Graz-Moraz.

Graz-Moraz was a city where elves and dwarves lived harmoniously and peacefully. They were trying to build a huge tower with 12 floors: 6 for the Dwarven gods and 6 for the Elven gods as a dedication. The tower, however, was never completed and was constantly falling down. But then a high priest of the Great Mother Sect of [[Drakainia]] appeared, who promised to help them if they would let him build a thirteenth floor with a bell. The tower was magically built in a day, and the bell, which belonged to [[Ireno]], began to ring of its own accord. Toxic rain and fog appeared out of nowhere, and fields began to be destroyed. Soon, a civil war started from fights between dwarves and elves, while mutations gradually appeared on them. Soon, the city was completely dissolved and [[Drakainia]] sucked the life force out of all the inhabitants. Then she understood that if she repeated it with more people she would be able to free herself completely from her prison.

After millennia, a group of believers finally were able to communicate with her. The church of St. Traft was founded, and they re-established the Sect of the Great Mother at [[Merkal]], which was nearby. They found the bell in the ruins of Graz-Moraz and attached it to their church, Merkal, and began their ceremony, where the first ring practically enabled Drakainia to summon her army again for the first time in millennia upon [[Naerk]].

A huge extradimensional portal opened to the northwest of [[Oventhart]], in [[Mherg Tundra]]. It was at this point that Huge creatures from the [[Void]] Plane began to appear and head towards Merkal in waves, tearing apart everything in their path. The bell continued to toll and call, while any attempt to enter St. Traft's church was hopeless, as magical protections and monstrosities guarded it. The city developed its defenses on the plain, bypassing any factional differences, in a first line of defense. Wild elves, forest giants, monks, wizards, guards and soldiers all joined with the intervention of the [[Halcyon]] and began to repel the attacks.

It soon became clear that the defense could not hold out forever. Each successive wave came stronger, with huge creatures with infinite eyes, tentacles and mental attacks. The defense was gradually giving way, and it became clear that the only way was for someone to go to the gate they were coming from and close it. And this job was undertaken by the [[Halcyon]], with the help of a few trusted friends and [[Twilight Veil]] that were aware of the events.

When they went there, they saw a vast area, like a globe, ten miles in radius, in which there was an absolute silence, and everything seemed dead. Inside were the ruins of [[Vivec]]'s laboratory, as well as wild elves that had completely come under Drakainia's control. In the center was a huge cliff, which seemed to have no depth and the void sucking in the light. Once inside, they found themselves on the [[Void]] Plane, the prison of [[Drakainia]], a place of immense gravity and void beyond all existence. There they fought and killed her, but it wasn't to end there.

The destruction of Drakainia and the simultaneous collapse of the demiplane, combined with the destruction of one of Vivec's creations released a massive amount of magical energy. A huge crater was created in the [[Mherg Tundra]]. The only outlet for this energy was the [[Material Plane]], and a huge cataclysmic disaster could be caused. But that day he had a full moon of [[Veth]], who absorbed all the magic drained of the demiplane destruction by an energy beam that hit him. This energy infused Veth's corpse with life force, and it began to shake and churn.

A huge ripple effect of color was created, in the aurora borealis, that lasted for days and drastically changed how Veth's radiation, and by extension magic, worked. Teleportation magic was greatly weakened beyond short distances, and so was dimension-shifting magic. In the northern regions appeared areas where magic worked unpredictably and various unexplained magical phenomena appeared, as some [[Vethians]] began to return to [[Material Plane]]. This event was called Vethfall.
