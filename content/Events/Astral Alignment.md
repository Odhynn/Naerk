A unique astral event where [[Naerk]], [[Qusm]], [[Veth]] and [[Sun]] aligned.  Then, with a series of spells carefully woven by Maeronian, all of Naerk went dark. At first no one understood what happened. Rumor has it that the Maenorian had created a huge hole in space-time, and soon the wizards of [[Xe'Farom]] began to exploit this change. Their spells had been enhanced even more: they could teleport vast distances in a matter of seconds, go back in time, or shape entire holes in space.

At that moment [[Yerastu]] took action. [[Sumril]] from [[Utopia]] that could deeply understand Veth's magic had warned him that this was very likely to happen, and once the Watcher realized that the balance of the Universe was threatened, he immediately intervened, capturing and imprisoning Maenorian. But he quickly saw that the problem only grew: his followers began experimenting with empowered magic on their own with very dangerous results, while a civil war for the leadership of Xe'Farom was about to break out, a civil war that would mean incalculable ramifications for the entire Na'erk. Then, Yerasthu saw that he was approaching the problem wrongly. Maeronian was an integral part of magic, and as much as he didn't like it, his existence was a necessary factor in stabilizing the situation. So they agreed to make an arcane pantheon with [[Sumril]] to control the arcane power.

Many sages believe that in the next Alignment Maeronian plans to break the agreement and repeat his magic spells. With his status now as the main god of magic, it is very likely that this new attempt will have a stronger effect than the last time, which could mean that all control over magic is lost and everyone uses it against will without any limit with what this entails, to the creation of massive explosions, time jumps, distortions in the earth and certain destruction.
