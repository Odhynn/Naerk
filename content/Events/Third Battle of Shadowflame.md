After the [[Second Battle of Shadowflame]], everyone knew that the next attack would be critical: If they could withstand it, they would gain valuable time to build walls on the side of the attacks. Three weeks had passed, and he had managed to build a ditch with spikes, and behind it a rough three-yard wall. This was also the only line of defense they could build for now. [[Marelthia]] had mobilized: Eight thousand soldiers had come from [[Sandling]], [[Keiron]], and [[Londoker]], and posted along the fortifications, which reached sixty miles in length, and assisted the workmen who had begun to complete them.

[[Teeso]] once again left to scout, while [[Keldar]] was promoted to lieutenant of the unit. He had proven both his worth in battle and his strategic thinking, being one of the few to be present at all engagements. Marelthia's force consisted of two thousand armored cataphracts, two thousand archers, five hundred scouts and light cavalry, and three and a half thousand infantry. Bows were issued to most of the unhorsed warriors, while the cavalry were placed between the gaps in the wall, ready to reinforce any point that came under pressure.

Then Teeso appeared, galloping as fast as he could. He jumped off the horse and found Keldar, who was talking with General [[Luardan]] and Lord [[Tergon]]. The undead were once again coming, and this time faster than ever. Mummified griffins and ghouls flew and ran across the desert, along with undead jackals and gnolls. Quickly the defense was manned with any warriors that were there, and they awaited the army which was coming with unabated speed.

In the distance the running jackals began to be seen, but the battle began even faster. The ground opened, and dust was thrown upon the walls: And with the dust, huge black scorpions, made bold of shadow. They had caustic poison in their stingers and with their pincers they cut the soldiers in two. Many warriors left their positions in panic, but soon realized they couldn't hide anywhere, so most stayed to fight. It took several warriors with spears, oil, and fire to kill them, and even so each of them killed a dozen before they fell.

They didn't have much time to regroup and the next wave came, jumping over the fortifications. Several were jolted by the rush of the pushing rearguard, but those who were short soon began stepping on the corpses of the dead to catch up, and the battle began in unabated intensity. The defenders again set fire to the thickest places and began to fight hand to hand on the walls. Soon, the casualties were heavy as these creatures stood over seven feet tall and wielded golden weapons with hieroglyphs, which they used to hack down the soldiers.

Keldar managed at his post to hold the wall and cut off their advance. He cast spells that summoned walls of fire and with his halberd killed anyone who came near. Looking around, he found that Teeso was missing, and saw that he had been busy as he had fallen from the walls to the ground and was single-handedly slicing through the army with his luminous sword. The CIV next to him was covering his back, and the two of them were enough to clear the field.

The barricades poured out of the gaps in the fortifications and attacked from the flanks at the most difficult points. Cavalry proved worthy of the occasion, as, unlike the walls, every loss of horseman equaled three dead jackals. Just when it seemed that the defense would hold, however, shadows covered the sky and black clouds fell on the walls. This time, unspeakable terror gripped the defenders. And if that supernatural effect wasn't enough, huge shadows appeared: Warriors twenty feet tall from the realm of Zulhan, with ancient weapons, who began to mow down those who dared to face them.

There were four of them, and they all rushed over to where Teeso was. The warrior deftly dodged the first blows, but was soon surrounded. CIV lunged at the former's throat and began ripping him apart as he prepared to cast a spell. [[Teeso]] seized the opportunity and cut off the shadow's leg. The giant knelt down and nailed him in the arms and stomach. The sword, with a flash, redeemed him. The second, however, knocked him down and caught him in his fist, invoking a freezing spell. The third brought down a sword to slaughter him, but a spear stopped the sword.

[[Keldar]] appeared out of nowhere and blocked the giant's blow. He began to parry the blows with magical protections, and his weapon had caught fire that drove the shadows away. He jumped to the side and dodged a huge yatagani that would have cut him in two, and then hit him in the leg, but with little success: It seemed that only weapons like Teeso's could be effective against them. The three giants surrounded the two warriors, and slaughtered any warrior foolish enough to help them.

Then [[Luardan]] appeared from the dust. Mounted and armored, he ran at his trained ati and fell headlong into the giant behind them. The lance went full on the shadow's knee, and she knelt screaming, and tried to slay him with a knife, but he withstood the blow with his shield. He drew his sword and began sword fighting the wounded shadow, until CIV jumped on her and clawed out her eyes and tore out her throat.

Teeso at the same time was able to stand up and draw a second sword. He jumped over a pitch black magic beam that violently exploded on the ground and began to dodge the blows of the second and third giant. He reached for his vibrant sword and grabbed it, instinctively slamming it into a massive fist that went for his head. The undead growled, and Teeso shouted an ancient word. The giant's entire arm suddenly caught fire, and the shadow erupted into a burst of light that blinded even the last giant. Keldar shouted an incantation and enveloped his weapon in azure fire, and with a few blows he brought it down, aided by Luardan.

Looking around, he saw that the defense held out once more, but the cost was enormous. One in four warriors who found themselves on the front line was dead or wounded, maybe a thousand. Most of the warriors were demoralized and had little appetite to celebrate their victory. The wisest quickly realized that this wall was here to stay, like a border between the living and the dead: Doubt gripped the leaders, as to what the future held and how much longer they could endure.

This time, Teeso headed west. He would go to [[Tithlon]] to find warriors to help him counterattack. He was determined to punish [[Talkeri]], as he was certain that this was all his own plan. And so he bid Keldar a temporary farewell, promising to return as soon as possible.
