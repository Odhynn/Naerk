> "This was the story I committed to record, because only 221 years have passed since the death of the most worthy elf in the history of the world and already, his story has started to obfuscate. For this very reason, in this book I will cite the facts, exactly as they were decided at the meeting."

## THE BEGINNING

The Council of the [[Five Sages of the North]] was named by the northern people as Cust Heirdosh or Skrûn. The meeting lasted 30 days in what most cultures call a month, and the topics of discussion were numerous and crucial. The purpose of this meeting was to record history, or even to define it, one might say. A sixth person, a historian from the South, participated, though his name was not recorded.

## THE FIRST MEETING (4221)

Ashiro's story was a central topic in this meeting, as he is the most reliable source of information regarding the [[Elemental Ring]], or even matters such as the creation of the [[Material Plane|Material World]], the Primordials and the war with each other. For this very reason the Council of the Five Sages of the North decided, among other things, to record Ashiro's story to keep iτ intact in case it needs to be backtracked in the future for other historical conclusions.
Records of the meeting registered these conclussions as well as marked for a second meeting that the 6 would hold in one year from the end of the first. This would have the purpose of approving, modifying and discussing the projects assigned to each member from the first meeting.
