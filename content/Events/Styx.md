With the battle between the Elemental Lords slowly settling down and Na'erk taking shape, [[Primordial]] [[Malahir]] expanded there. She made the first living organisms, and their spirits communicated with the Evergrowing Forest, and took the nickname mother nature. But it was clear that in this process a catalyst was needed, an agent that would multiply the creation of life on Na'erk. It was clear that Fyrlean could not and did not want to help this process This unexpected help then came from [[Reszek]] and the first souls were formed.

But Malahir did not define this very important parameter of her creation: The formation of souls. Their appearance in the material dimension allowed several of them to develop their intelligence and gain consciousness within a short period of time from the moment conscious formed. Eventually, the first souls were created: Beasts, monsters, humanoids and [[giants]], while around the same time the elves ([[elvehnans]]) became mortal.

Realizing the extent the life phenomenon was taking, [[Amehan]] couldn't sit idly by, especially since he had understood Nahema's hand was behind all that. By his own intervention, all the creatures of Malahir became mortal. Once the souls were created, Amehan made a trap, the river Styx, also known as Orovos, and it was one of his most important and magnificent creations. The Styx originally was intended to be a dimensional trap that would communicate with all planes and capture all souls. But Orovos quickly spiraled out of control. Feeding on the memories and experiences of souls, it quickly gained consciousness and personality, and threatened to destroy the entire edifice of Malahir and creation.

Then, since in her despair Malahir could find no other solution, she called upon all the gods. She made them a proposal, that she believed was to everyone's benefit. If everyone helped to contain Styx and her power, then she would free the souls from the [[Evergrowing Forest]] and everyone would appoint an objective judge, in a transitional dimension, who would determine where each soul would end up according to their actions in life. Most of the gods thought they would gain from this, so they fought together in all dimensions against Styx. The problem presented itself very quickly: If they destroyed it, they would also destroy the souls inside it. Thus, they left Orovos severely injured and unconscious. It still gradually assimilates the souls that spend too much time inside it and steals memories from the imprisoned, but is now merely just a communication bridge and a vessel between dimensions.
