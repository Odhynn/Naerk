In the southern plains of Oromil, after an unusual drought in the year 4751, nature was struggling. Grass was almost non-existent in the once verdant valleys, water limited to a few oases and the heat unbearable. Ten buffaloes from a herd had died in a pit, huddled in the shade of a dried-up bog, trying to soak up the last drops of water. At this point and time, two hungry and thirsty dragons met. These were [[Akerosoth]] and [[Haldisoir]], blue and brass respectively.

Haldisoir was one of the most famous dragons in the east. While certainly not the greatest, he lived on the fringes of civilization and accordingly had little respect in the [[Dragonpact]]. He considered himself too important and powerful to be limited by its laws, and the only exception to this was probably that he had accepted [[Droghor]] as his apprentice and teaching him arcane draconic arts. Even that was most likely because he was bored in solitude and wanted company from someone who understood the way of fire.
Akerosoth on the other hand, although a lesser dragon, adhered to the Dragonpact to the letter. She had great respect for its values, and believed it was the only way they could prevent a bloodbath between dragons and humanoids. She had chosen isolation by choice, even though she might not have been viewed so hostilely in some quarters. The main reason was that she had an extremely important mission: she was tasked with protecting one of the four [[Solarium Rings]], and she took this task very seriously.

When the two dragons met, it was the period when Akerosoth was pregnant. Not only was she in dire need of food, but according to the Dragonpact, the area was hers by law in every way. Haldisoir seemed completely unaware of this, and since he was bigger and stronger, he demanded all the food, and Akerosoth in her condition could not refuse or fight him. She contented himself with contacting the Dragonpact to settle the matter once and for all, which after all was not about a meal but a selfish dragon.

The Dragonpact responded, sending the [[Pactkeepers]] to settle the matter. However, the situation progressed a little unexpectedly. The Pactkeepers sent there were inexplicably killed, while a local [[Bloodscale]] sect took over instead. The situation dragged on for almost 25 years, during which time Haldisoir ended up working closely with them due to force majeure. This situation created considerable chaos in the valley, which got worse by the [[Battle of Fellgaunt]], until the matter was settled by the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]] in the year 4776.
