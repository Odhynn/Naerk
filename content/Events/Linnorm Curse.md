In ancient times, in the heart of the north, two dragons had an intense, one might say, anti-jealousy. This rivalry started from who will have more territory, but its real reason was different: The two dragons were fighting over who is a real dragon and who is not. But this conflict also had racial differences: The former had four limbs and wings, while the latter had only two, and a much thinner and longer body: also known as Linnorm. The first was called Fraugmeneir and the second Vagur.

Their rivalry was to destroy entire regions as the two, huge in size, began to battle in the wild tundra. All day they fought, and all night they licked their wounds and vowed revenge in their aggrieved hearts. The earth shook from their battle, and the northerners fled the area in terror. Few people know it, but there was a reason why their battle was never ending. Fraugmeneir used spells to heal his wounds, while Vagur had the ability to close his wounds very quickly: Thus, their battle seemed to never end.

The confrontation of these two beasts was watched even by gods. The Acts wanted it to end, for the north was ravaged by their battle: the plain had been devastated, and famine had spread to many villages: Odyrmos, or Ferelga. When cities began to fall apart in their battle, Malahir suddenly appeared and gave them an ultimatum: Within one day, their battle must end and they must stop destroying nature. Neither of them seemed willing to give in to the goddess's blackmail as both of them suddenly began to fear for their lives. Then, Malahir said she would reward both the winner and the loser to give them an incentive to stop.

The two rivals looked into each other's eyes for a long time, and then rushed at each other. They began to beat and scrape against the ground, flattening the tundra and the hills: Now, each of their blows was like a small earthquake. But Fraugmeneir after a few hours began to gain the upper hand: He was able to pin Vagur to the ground and called Malahir.
"Give me my gift! I'll give him life, dammit!"
At the same time, Vagur spoke in a whisper. "Help, Malahir! I have lost, fighting fair!"

The goddess appeared before them. Roots and leaves took the shape of a beautiful woman, with eyes that shone in the deep green of the forest.
"To the loser, I give the gift of freedom and healing! May no one ever be able to catch you, and may your wounds heal faster than ever! To the winner..."
Vagur began to emerge from the dirt and mud. Fraugmeneir's grip on him suddenly seemed very weak, while all of his wounds were closing at a rapid rate. As the dragon turned to look at Malahir, Vagur made his move. It shook with lightning speed, and bit Fraugmeneir in the neck: The dragon did not expect this attack, and Vagur's teeth snapped shut. Within moments, Fraugmeneir was dead, while Malahir could not believe what had happened.

She began to hunt Linnorm furiously, but she was already very tired: She realized that the gift to Vagur had weakened her. Even worse, Vagur, with his new powers, was able to avoid her, her every attempt to catch or injure him. After two days, Malahir stopped hunting and returned to the scene of the battle. He took Vagur's blood and cursed it: Forever, his blood and that of his kind be poison to all but themselves, and never be welcomed by any animal or plant. He exiled those in the Evergrowing Forest, from where they came from, and severed all ties with them. Finally, as the gift he had promised to Fraugmeneir, he resurrected him and gave him immense strength and endurance: And then he left the material dimension, as he was weakened and humiliated.

Linnorms found refuge everywhere in the north, and quickly most became truly hated by every local. Their penchant for destruction, combined with the Unnatural Curse, made them the fear and terror of many regions. In fact, many Linnorm Hunters appeared with the sole purpose of exterminating them, in cooperation with the Wyrmsfall. However, any such attempt has a high chance of failure, as well as many losses. As for Vagur, his fate is unknown as he hides away in the glaciers. Only three have seen him since and lived to tell the tale: Velchor the Bold, Jarl Sn√•fr Kugroen of the Bear Clan, and Falgyrd Bolrag, one of the most renowned Linnorm Hunters.
