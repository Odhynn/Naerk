Lake Kiribung, north of Fervolosh, traditionally belonged to the [[Volnoch]] (Underpine) tribe. It was outside of the border with the [[Daral]] (Fir) who owned the forests to the west, but very close to the border with the [[Skra]] (Steady Hand). So when in the spring of 4818 Volnoch's fishermen saw Skra soldiers on the opposite bank, they knew their claim was not so sure. A small group went to speak to them, but were met with arrows and threats. That was enough reason for Volnoch to start a war.

Within two days, six hundred Volnoch warriors gathered and circled the lake, to retaliate against the encamped [[Skra]]. Their leader was [[Raka]] Trell, an experienced warrior but quite short-tempered. Upon seeing the Skra, he attacked without a word. The Skra, who did not expect such a reaction, were not ready for such a thing. They had fifty archers and as many infantry, and even the arrows of the archers were not very effective. The Volnoch had strong shields and had no more than ten casualties. Under the leadership of Raka, they fell upon them and began to slaughter them. A small group of Skra held the line for the last to leave.

The massacre was unprecedented. Among the dead, [[Baga]] Lurok, brother of Galnagh Meegar, fell fighting heroically. Two dozen warriors were able to escape, while the last ones holding a line of defense fell, including [[Helden]] Curnag. The nephew of the Skra shaman had knocked down five Volnoch warriors with his spear when he confronted Raka. The second, a seasoned veteran and armorer, broke the spear with his sword and brought it down on [[Helden]]'s head. But he stooped down, tripped Raka with the back end of his spear and was the last to leave the carnage. A warrior went to block his way, but cut his throat with a hunting knife he had.

The Skra next day declared war on the Volnoch, and said that they had come to the lake to negotiate its shores, not to start a conflict. But for the Volnoch, the shores were non-negotiable. These events led to the [[Second Battle of Kiribung]].
