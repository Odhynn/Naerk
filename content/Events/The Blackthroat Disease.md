[[Stephan]] has been a baron for four years in the city of [[Marjalat]]. Many whispered that he had become very introverted and antisocial, and as the years went by, he was venturing less and less out of his villa. His family was traditionally faithful to [[Veiroch]] and his sister had died and became a ghost inside the villa after a ceremony in the name of the God. His brothers, who had died of illness, were much more promising than him. In fact, the one who held the class and consistency in the last year was his wife, [[Anyssa]], who was from the neighboring city of [[Kel-Arga]].

In the summer of 4817, a special weird disease began to spread in the city, called Blackthroat. The first symptoms were black circles in the eyes, and then tanning on the cheeks and neck, until the throat was completely swollen. The victims were slowly becoming paranoid after a few days, screaming incessantly, and often had aggressive behavior. In the final stages, they became even more paramount, and in most cases undead shadows came out and killed the victim. These shadows then terrorized the city.

As a first measure of treatment, Anyssa imposed a ban on travel to and from the city to limit the spread of the disease. Most were in a hurry to sprinkle the Shadowfolk, the city's residents who had genes from Shadow Plane. Although they could transmit the disease as carriers, they did not present any of the symptoms. Subsequently, however, he began to whisper that the evil started from the palace. Kel-Arga's Duke [[Naldar]], in order to learn the situation of his daughter, [[Anyssa]], sent a small group to find out what happened and to ensure her health: the mage [[Ludvig]], the servant [[Malthis]], the alchemist [[Delishart]] and the barbarian [[Bjonnyr]] from the north.

Within a few days, the scene began to clarify, even though the disease cause more dead on a daily basis. The culprit of this situation was Baron [[Stephan]] himself. He had used a [[Veiroch]] heirloom that belonged to his family to become the first in the line of succession and take power in his hands. He thought that what he was using was a mere mirror that kicked his brothers into another dimension of torture, but in fact this mirror was infected by the Shadow Plane. It then became known as the [[Mirror of Souls]].

The cost he paid to imprison them in the mirror was very high, and in the end he could not repay it to [[Nessessor]], who was the shadow leader of the mirror's demiplane. The life of both Anyssa and their newborn child was now threatened. The creatures of the mirror were therefore poured into the city, seeking revenge. And in his attempt to make an agreement with a creature of light, known as [[Ilquar]], to help him solve the problem, he made things worse. Because, this creature began to sacrifice innocent of his own personal motives.

Only when the Duke Naldar envoys were able to do the damage that the damage was restricted and the causes come to light. They killed Ilquar and stopped his human sacrifices, while Stephan was forced to reveal his secret. They entered the mirror and killed Nessessor and his faithful shadows. After piercing the heart of the mirror, it broke from inside, and among those who released from within, was Stephan's nephew, the son of his firstborn brother. The world, when the story learned, was furious, but the disease in the city stopped after breaking the mirror.

In the end, with Anyssa's intervention, which still maintained power, residents of the city agreed to stay in power for another 8 years, until the reign of Rennis, his niece. Some accepted this because Rennis was Shadowfolk, and they didn't want to be ruled by such a one, as they were afraid that the same tragedy could replay once again. In fact, rumors have been raging, and rumors of what happened really began to separate from reality. Naldar, however, and his daughter, took the opportunity to strengthen their power in Marjalat, while from the envoys, Ludvig, Malthis and Del'ishart stayed there for a while to impose order on Anyssa's side.
