Although one of the most famous commercial destinations, the island of Zolkar could never come completely under her authority Imtaria. This is for a number of reasons.

Initially, a number of local pirates and traders had turned to the slave market. [[Imtaria]] could not and did not want to clash together them, because their political influence was huge. So even though there were supervising commissioners on the island, officials either turned a blind eye or were absolutely corrupt themselves, and accepted bribes from the locals factors. Very soon the slave market took on enormous proportions. Even though the slavers' buying and selling took place in a country that was subject to [[Palaurim]], eventually a slave could without any interference be moved by his master across the land, from [[South Darrok]], [[Oromil]], as far as the [[Green Hills]]. The situation was also favored by constant skirmishes in [[Hashnev]] and [[Rammok Wastes]], since prisoners of war were sent on the spot to [[Elestair]]'s slave markets. Various pirate gangs were also involved in this circuit, which were harboring merchant ships south of Zolkar, in Catfish Gulf, with their lair the dens of Pan-Taram.

Under these circumstances, the [[Berenfaer]] were created. This secret group was formed to crush slavery, and was supported by all nationalities. Its action was soon outlawed but the agents could and did penetrate deep into the smuggling ring. The slaves were becoming more and more numerous, so Berenfaer dynamics and their possibilities expanded
respectively and were supported by many in secret, as well as by natives who abhorred slavery and the corruption of the state.

As if slave trade was not enough, with the tolerance of some of the worst slave traders a cult of [[Karadosh]] developed in the underground canals of Elestair. They built in the lower underground temples and began to take slave followers trafficked in the underground canals of the city. They used the slaves for sacrifices and to strengthen their powers by unholy ceremonies which they gave them animal characteristics and made them go crazy. Very quickly they gained absolute control over the city's sewers, and this made them the Berenfaer and those who supported them even more convinced in the efforts to abolish corruption and slavery.

The situation looked like a boiling cauldron, but it was stagnant. However, the winter of the year 4817, the spark that set the plain on fire was about to fall. As a Berenfaer agent disappeared while exploring the basements passages, a team of elite scouts was sent to find him. The didn't think they had much chance of success, but things eventually evolved a bit differently. Entering the canals through an entrance to a slave market, the group set off a fight with the thugs in the middle of an slave auction, which ended
with the slaves breaking free and occupying the entire building in a bloody rebellion. The group then made it all the way to Karadosh's temple and put an end to the power of the heretics. At the same time, the forces of Berenfaer gathered almost entirely in the occupied building and defended it against the thugs and the corrupt guards.

The governor could not immediately send the garrison to quell it rebellion, because then he would accept the existence of slavery. However, he did turn a blind eye to the battle and indirectly reinforced the slavers with weapons and direct statutory provisions for immunity in their actions. However, the soldiers quickly found themselves fighting their fellow citizens and slaughtering each other, while chaos reigned in Elestair since the begining. The situation had a huge economic impact on the city and threatened the image of Imtaria all the way out. So, the governor ordered a halt of hostilities and gave full rights as well as limited political power to Berenfaer and the freed slaves, with their leaders [[Steelshade]], [[Algirith]] Evergreen, [[Nerash]] and [[Black Mist]].
