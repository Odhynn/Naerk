The gods who had allied with [[Auromia]] when she created the [[Ethereal Plane]] now each had their own realm. Of these, four had survived: [[Sumril]], [[Yast]], [[Voolthow]] and [[Malahir]]. What none of them had anticipated, however, was her return. Her essence had not been completely lost during the creation of the Ethereal Plane, but had been dispersed throughout space. She gradually gathered strength, until her mighty entity gained consciousness. Her ability to affect the space and her power was not the same as before, but her hatred was definitely immense.

When she found out what had happened to her subjects, she was filled with rage. First she visited Voolthow, who had to muster all his diplomacy to stop her from annihilating him on the spot. Voolthow claimed that he was the only one who had succeeded so strongly in furthering Auromia's own goals to enter the [[Material Plane]] and corrupt it. Auromia was convinced of his sincerity, but decided to use him as a mere submissive in order to avenge the others. During that time, many in the material plane began to wake up or have nightmares in their sleep as Auromia infiltrated the [[Dreamworld]] undisturbed. Next was the [[Void]] Plane, where Yast saw the coming of Auromia from afar, wanting nothing to do with the events on the Material Plane. She herself thought it was not worth the effort and decided to deal with him in due course.

She focused on the other two: Sumril and Malahir. These two very quickly realized that despite their different approaches, if they did not join forces their demise would be swift. Malahir called upon the [[Elemental Lords]] and [[Reszek]] to help her repel Auromia before she invaded the Evergrowing Forest. They helped as much as they could, but their powers were limited to the realm of the fifth dimension, and only some of their subjects were able to enhance its powers. Auromia, with her presence, began to create ethereal creatures, which attacked the defenses of the [[Evergrowing Forest]] and [[Utopia]].

For a period of a month, the two-plane defense held up well. Auromia could not enter, and the army defending the place seemed to be holding out and suffered few casualties. That is, until Voolthow came to back her up. Countless shadows, ghosts, treacherous spirits and wraiths in his service rushed into the Evergrowing forest, where they encountered a waiting army of fey. The fey had the advantage as they started with spells and silver arrows at first, but when the ghosts got close, they began to pick off the defenders one by one and overwhelm them with their numbers. Auromia's mental magic was very difficult for the defenders to deal with, as it was like water extinguishing fire. Her nature and the way she ignored many obstacles was unique.

Auromia then found that in order to destroy the Forest for good, she had to destroy the tree at its center, called [[Volrek]], the Sentinel. It was the first creature of Malahir and had grown to enormous proportions, making it now the foundation of the Plane. Auromia's army advanced deeper and deeper into the forest. Then Malahir called upon all the [[Aspects]], the spirit-gods of nature, to help her, which she had never done before. And so great was the need that called them, that they laid aside all their egos and vendetas and came all seventeen to fight side by side: From [[Berohath]] to [[Lastra]] and from [[Mormankar]] to [[B'tolen]]. The battle was fierce, and two of them died under the vast strain of the hostile army: The Pride of the Lion and the Trample of the Bison. At the same time, [[Il'vec]] was cut off and imprisoned.

Malahir found that even then they could not hold the opposing army. [[Drokasner]] and [[Lastra]] were holding temporarily Voolthow's vice-leaders, while Crel'vach was about to succumb to Auromia's mental attacks, with Shadow of the Clouds dead. Then she went and touched [[Volrek|the Sentinel]], and addressed his spirit.
_"My old friend, I don't know if it's wise, but there is a way to win this battle."_
The Sentinel was slow to respond, and when he did, the entire plane seemed to shake. He mourned the thousands of lost souls. _"I know. But the price is heavy."_
_"I'm willing to pay for it."_ She said.
_"Then let it be so. Don't regret it though, for this day is dark anyway."_
_"Goodbye, my friend."_

At that moment, all the lighting on the battlefield changed. Because Malahir had impersonated Auromia and dissolved her essence in order to cast a spell of equal power to Auromia to create a new dimension. But unlike Auromia, she didn't have that much power, and she didn't or couldn't create a new plane. Instead, she completely transported the entire Evergrowing Forest to the Material Plane. Volrek was anchored to a point in space on the surface of Na'erk, and all the creatures and objects of the Evergrowing Forest were transported there, relative to the Sentinel Tree.

All of the patrons of the Evergrowing Forest continued to fight normally, as in the material dimension not only did Malahir have absolute dominance, but at the same time the Elemental Lords were able to come down to help her. Auromia's army was also been drawn to the Material Plane but every creature was a pitiful version of its immaterial form, ungainly and unwieldy. Within minutes, Auromia's entire army was annihilated in a unique display of nature's mustered power. The place was filled with floods, storms, fires, earthquakes and cyclones. Pretty soon Auromia was a thing of the past.

The Evergrowing Forest however remained after the battle in Na'erk. Spirits, fey and gods wandered aimlessly in the forest, and everything seemed meaningless, hazy, with Malahir's death. For a year, nature withered and died, no plants flourished, and nature was gradually decaying. Only Volrek's efforts could keep nature from collapsing without the Primordial.

And then, the following year, after one of the harshest winters Na'erk had known, Malahir appeared reincarnated. With the coming of spring, he managed to reverse the spell, causing the Evergrowing Forest and all its patrons to return to the Ethereal Plane and the cycle of nature to return to its normal rhythm.

However, a race of fey and some other unique creatures, out of their curiosity to explore the world, had during this time come out of the forest's boundaries. These fey did not return that spring, and took on permanent flesh and blood, and were called Gnomes. The rest of the creatures also took permanent material form, and can be found in various regions of Na'erk: Unicorns, pegasus, moving trees (Krel), satyrs, and more.

As for the forest, it is now called Blackwood and is on the border between Overthart and Allwick. The few travelers who have passed through have seen what remains of the material forms of the returning patrons: Black withered trees and plants, infinite skeletons, and decay all around. Rumors of undead still wandering there and unique exotic creatures and Deeds roaming there have not been verified.
