After the slaughter of the [[Skra]] tribesmen on the [[First Battle of Kiribung]], they declared war on the [[Volnoch]], and said that they had come to the lake to negotiate its shores, not to start a conflict. But for the Volnoch, the shores were non-negotiable.

Shaman [[Uldrek]] called for a general muster, sent [[Meegar]] Lurok with two thousand warriors to restore their honor and found an equal number of Volnoch warriors waiting for them east of the lake, under the leadership of [[Jargon]], son of Elder [[Kaldran]], leader of the tribe. The two sides camped out, as neither wanted to make the first move.

[[Meegar]] then devised a plan to win. He left two-thirds of his army in camp and took a small party of archers and trackers and went round the lake by night, from the western woods. The elves of [[Daral]] kept a close eye on this army, and fired some warning arrows, to keep them from approaching their territories. Just before the dawn, Volnoch spies told Jargon that the opposing camp looked half-abandoned: Wanting to seize the opportunity he gathered his soldiers, sounded the horns and attacked the Skra camp.

[[Helden]] was again at the head of the defense. He called the warriors to form a wall with their shields on the planted spikes of the camp and shouted to hold to the end. But Jargon with his bodyguard, warriors in heavy armor, aided by two druids who were in the form of huge boars, broke through the line of defense at one point and began slaughtering the Skra soldiers. Helden continued to hold the defense, inflicting heavy casualties on the left of the line. With the lake to their side, he knew they had to hold that position, because there they couldn't be surrounded. And despite heavy losses in the center, with Jargon trying to throw them into the lake, they held on.

At first light, a second horn sounded, behind the [[Volnoch]]. [[Meegar]] had rounded the lake and ran into the rearguard of the attackers. Many say that's when he proved the name "Murder Hawk". He was slaughtering anyone he found without mercy, and they came upon Jargon's company in full force. Seeing him, Helden called out his warriors to break through the shield wall and attack: and they did. The Skra fell from two sides on the Volnoch, and soon the battle began to tilt in their favor. All were afraid to attack [[Meegar]] head-on, and many threw down their weapons and fled. The half-orc called out to the warriors to regroup and they chased down whoever was leaving.

Only Jargon's bodyguard was able to retreat in an orderly fashion. [[Trygg]], Jargon's friend, came to his side, and slew with his ax whoever came near, while the latter gave orders and protected him with his shield. [[Helden]] Curnag attacked [[Jargon]] with his spear, but Trygg pushed him back. The blow though was enough to send Jargon's helmet flying. The rearguard continued to fall back, but then [[Meegar]] arrived, seeing Jargon momentarily unprotected: He climbed a tree, and leapt upon him, driving his ax into his skull. Trygg rushed at the assassin, but it was too late: Jargon was dead. This was a critical morale blow for [[Volnoch]]. They fled, while a few [[Raka]] archers shot arrows at the Skra to stop the pursuit.

The battle was decided. The southern side of the lake passed permanently to the Skra, while the Volnoch mourned their losses, which numbered over seven hundred, against three hundred of the Skra. They also accused the [[Daral]] of letting such an expeditionary force pass through their territory unmolested, and of being complicit. The Daral retorted that they had warned the Skra not to advance, and that they were even more unprepared to face the passing army. Be that as it may, this led to rearrangements in all three clans. Elder Shaman [[Kaldran]] became more paranoid than ever with the death of his son. [[Raka]] started border skirmishes and skirmishes with the Skra, while Meegar gained even more power in the Skra, to the dismay of many. At the same time, several of the Daral border guards were fingered for their inaction. The situation in the three tribes remained unstable.
