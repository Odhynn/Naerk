## Background

Huge riots broke on most parts of [[Imtaria]] during the rule of the incompetent [[Emperor Kaldos IV]] Neruso. Among the rioting mob, there was a nobleman, [[Emperor Nilengar I|Lord Nillengar Ragas]], who openly questioned the emperor's authority and condemned his decisions. He was a great merchant and shipmaster, and the castellan of [[Syvorms]]. People from all walks of life began to rally to Nillengar's side, and soon a massive campaign towards the capital began, which met little resistance from the officials. Two-thirds of the guards openly supported Nillengar, and only a tenth of the soldiers sent from [[Vaedar]] tried to stop him.

The decisive battle was fought on the plains east of [[Lanxia]], ​​and was called by both sides Traitors Field. The emperor's supporters numbered only eight thousand, against fifty thousand regulars and irregulars who were on Nillengar's side. The lord broke their lines with a cavalry charge, but respected those who surrendered afterwards. His march continued to Vaedar, where he found the gates open and the people hailing him as a hero.

## Aftermath

The palace was closed, however, as the Imperial Guard had sworn to protect the emperor with their lives. No one wanted to break their oath, so everyone locked themselves inside and prepared for a siege. The palace was impregnable and the first attempts to scale the massive walls failed miserably. Nillengar's attempts to enter continued over the next few days, but to no avail. The few climbers who reached the ramparts met a tragic end at the hands of the guards, and no ladder was high enough to reach the top.

In the second week, a new recruit of the Imperial Guard impaled the Emperor with his spear. His name has been erased from all books, and the guard next to him killed the traitor without a second thought. The emperor's murderer, and traitor to his oath, is the greatest oathbreaker in the entire history of the Imperial Guard, and many say that he was manipulated by magic to do so. In any case, with Kaldos dead, the siege was lifted, the palace opened, and Nillengar proclaimed himself Emperor, with the people and nobles cheering him on.

The riots and battle marked the official end of the Neruso emperor dynasty and the ascension of the Ragas emperor dynasty in the Empire of [[Imtaria]].
