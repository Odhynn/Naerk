## History of Dragons

Among the first creatures to live on Na'erk were dragons. They appeared during the period when its surface was full of volcanoes, waves and storms. The elements were raging. Some argue that the dragons predate the Na'erk, and that some of the oldest took part in the final period of the Primordial War. But one thing is certain: Although there were other creatures earlier, such as titans, some elementals, extraterrestrials and various monstrosities, dragons were the first living crystallization of primitive victories in this world. And because many times many [[Primordials]] participated in these battles, each victory was reflected in various forms of dragons.

Dragons, creatures of immense size and unnatural strength, possess various supernatural powers depending on their element, as well as energy breath and aura inherited from the elements they came from. Since they had so much power in their hands, and were by nature very selfish and arrogant, their first target was the populations of the smaller races, and especially the intelligent ones, who found them particularly annoying.

The dragon attacks on the human, orc and elf races seemed unstoppable. At that time, civilizations were not yet developed, and no society or city could be sure that it could withstand the threat of a dragon. With each raid, houses were leveled and burned, people died by the hundreds and the inhabitants took a long time to emerge from their shelters, in the areas that were hit by the wrath of the creatures. Then, [[Wyrmsfall]] was founded.

The Wyrmsfall were a group of skilled hunters, trappers, warriors and wizards tasked with protecting the cities, scouting and hunting dragons. This group was strengthened and supported by many veterans of the three clans, and enjoyed acceptance and recognition in many countries. They concentrated their efforts on hunting and killing small dragons, as well as destroying nests. As the power of the Wyrmsfall grew, they were slowly able to pose a threat to larger dragons as well. And thus they finally killed [[Karlhendinium]], the white storm.

## Formation of the Treaty

Then the wisest of the dragons realized that the effects of their arrogance were getting worse and worse for themselves. Their numbers were constantly dwindling, while the civilizations of the small tribes spread, and they could replenish their population very quickly. Then six dragons gathered at [[Sunshine]], in [[Gaulgir]]:

1. **[[Draun'vlohoth]], the Scarred**
2. **[[Fraugmeneir]]**
3. **[[Kensalea]], Fury of the Storm**
4. **[[Nentha]] the Wise**
5. **[[Pangra-Lu]]**
6. **[[Merinthinix]]**

These six dragons called the chieftains of the Wyrmsfall, as well as the kings of each country, to a meeting, and many responded to their call.

Immediately, the reason for the meeting was revealed: the dragons sought a truce. Realizing the unique opportunity they had in hand, the attending kings and queens decided to agree, and bound the Wyrmsfall leaders to follow through. This is how the Dragonpact was defined in the year 1983: The terms by which dragons, as well as their hunters, were bound. The Dragonpact was implemented in many areas of Na'erk, and it is not difficult to understand how it was done with mutual concessions on both sides. The dragons went one step further and instrumented this condition and attacks between dragons to ensure the species' reproduction. The treaty included 6 rules:

## The Dragonpact

> 1. *A dragon does not have the right to invade within a radius of half a mile in a society of 30-100 inhabitants, one mile in a society of up to 500 inhabitants, two miles in a society of up to 2000 inhabitants, five miles in a society of up to 5000 inhabitants , ten miles in a society of as many as 10000 inhabitants and twenty miles in larger ones. He may enter this zone only with the agreement of the local authority.*
> 2. *The radius of an adult dragon's territory is an area equal to the distance it can fly and return to its nest in one day. Another population or another dragon may settle in this area, but their safety is not guaranteed by the treaty and they do not have the right to attack the dragon.*
> 3. *A female dragon with eggs or young is considered an adult and gains territory for ten years. Anyone from either side who unnecessarily disturbs her in her territory is punished by the [[Pactkeepers]].*
> 4. *A dead dragon's territory passes to the first adult dragon or society to settle there, unless there is an adult heir designated by the dead dragon.*
> 5. *Those countries that sign the treaty, must observe it and ensure that it is enforced, as well as appoint the creation of Pactkeepers, who punish anyone who does not observe it with the help of Wyrmsfall. For this purpose, 6 Listeners, who detect illegalities, and 12 enforcers, who deliver justice, are appointed. 1/3 of them are set to be Wyrmsfall and 1/3 of them dragons.*
> 6. *In any case, the Council of Three, consisting of the Dragon King of Sunshine, the leader of the Pactkeepers and the representative of the Wyrmsfall, has the final say on any issue. Listeners vote for the leader with a tie being broken by a randomly elected enforcer, and a leader's maximum term is 30 years.*
