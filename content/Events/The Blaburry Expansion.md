The dragons' expansion into northern [[Drozzin]] was by no means bloodless. The indigenous forces of nature that resided there belatedly realized the magnitude of the threat, and rallied to face it. Of the fey chieftains that left when the dragons arrived in Blaburry Forest, the most powerful was an old hag witch named [[Tikimura]]. She tried to gather as many forest warriors as he could in time, and appointed Nymph [[Queen Valauri]] as deputy leader, who could control the animals and plants in the east of the forest.

As the enemy forces arrived, Valauri ordered kitsune archers to shoot arrows at the dragons and bloodscales. The arrows were enhanced with deadly poison by Tikimura, and when they fell upon the enemy ranks they caused many casualties and panic. However, the [[Bloodscale]] regrouped and returned to the attack. A huge sea dragon, [[Alfavriix]], dashed through the trees, uprooting them, and melted half a company of archers with her acid breath. Taking advantage of the gap in the defense, armored bloodscale foot soldiers charged in and began killing tengu and kitsune, who lacked the same armor and training to hold their formation.

What the fey didn't know was that they had a traitor in their ranks, [[Flux]]. A tiny creature, 3 feet tall, had given up its cave on the coast to [[Klemnestron]]'s followers after their threats. There they began to perform ceremonies to strengthen the [[Bloodscale]] warriors and weaken the power of [[Queen Valauri]] over the local flora and fauna. And while at first the trees themselves smote passing warriors, and the bears of the forest fought with dragons, after a while they began to lay dormant or flee. The battle would end in total defeat for the fey.

Valauri understood that this magical intervention began in her own area, but in order for it to be successful, the invitation of one of the locals was necessary. She begged her warriors, even at the last moment, for whoever was to blame to admit it and save the forest. Guilty from his remorse, Flux admitted it, and Valauri cursed him to enjoy nothing until they recaptured the temple. She gathered a few of her trusted warriors and Tikimura and they teleported to the seaside temple.

Waiting for them there was none other than [[Alfavriix]], who had reinforced the temple's defenses with lizardmen. Tikimura with a spell broke the stone entrance and the fey rushed inside. The witch made their weapons glow as they began to slaughter the lizardmen, and soon they were near the shrine. There, Alfavriix was waiting for them, who started throwing acid at them and slaughtering anyone who came near with her thorny claws. Valauri jumped on her back and began to stab her with her sword, but she threw her down and raised her leg to melt her.

Tikimura chanted an incantation and the dragon's leg was impaled on a stalactite sticking out of the ground. She screamed in pain and tried to run away, but Tikimura threw flaming bats at her which blew her head off. Valauri took advantage of the situation and impaled her neck with her sword, while Tikimura began to run into the temple to find the priests, passing under the dying dragon. Arriving at the shrine, she found dozens of priests waiting for her, some chanting divine curses against her and others continuing the ceremony.

She knew he didn't have time. She had to act fast before she was killed. She floated in the air, and engulfed herself in flames, sucking the souls of her warriors who were nearby, and sacrificed their life energy in an explosion that charred all the priests' bodies and melted even the stones on the altar. Suddenly, the spells broke, and Valauri mentally ordered the forces back in the forest to fight back. With renewed vigor, they drove the enemy out of the forest as word began to spread through their ranks that Alfavriix was dead. This forest also became the border of the dragons' territory.

Valauri, surrounded by dozens of lizardmen, was able to knock four down, but she was netted and captured. The few fey who tried to save her were slaughtered by [[Ozrallon]], the enraged son of Alfavriix. He hunted down those who remained and made the ruins of the temple his home, while imprisoning the Valauri and as many fey as he could capture. No one dared to go into the cave to save the queen, except Flux, who was helpless.

Many decades after, in 4818, a group of travelers found Ozrallon's lair. Once Flux told them what happened, they attacked the lizardmen, freed Valauri, and with her help killed Ozrallon and took Tikimura to the Evergrowing Forest for her final resting place. The temple was destroyed and the Valauri restored nature to the area and forgave Flux for his betrayal.
