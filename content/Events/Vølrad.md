According to the annals of Arothal the Distant, it is estimated that in total there have been more than sixty tribes in Fervolosh throughout the ages. From this admission alone it is not puzzling to understand how much bloodshed under normal circumstances would have taken place in the effort of all these tribes for their dominance and influence in the forest. And that's because the amount of land each person has available for hunting, fishing, water, natural resources and shelter is vital to a tribe's survival. At the same time, many tribes had disputes over ceremonies, rituals, kinsmen and other issues. Jealousies and disputes in the forest could potentially reach great proportions.

Precisely for this reason, Vølrad was set after [[Feralga|the Wail]] and the three-year war with the goblins. This is a way of settling disputes between two or more tribes and was established in the year 2858. Everyone is bound to respect Vølrad's result. Arothal is said to have studied all the Vølrad and recorded all the victors, their exploits and the history of the feuds between the respective tribes.

Vølrad usually takes place in the sacred grounds surrounding the [[Torniv |Stone House]]. The rules agreed upon are as follows:

I. The tribes involved discuss and decide the Vølrad rules and appoint their representative(s).

II. The council is called, consisting of an optional emissary called a Galdosh from each forest tribe not involved in the dispute (each Galdosh may be accompanied by a warrior called a Galnagh). The council is finalized two weeks after its convening. During these two weeks the rules can be changed by the tribes involved but council approval is required. Contenders cannot be changed. If a rule has not been decided by then, the council sets its own.

III. On the 15th day, Vølrad begins with the first light of day and must end by the next equinox or solstice (until the end of the Northern month).

IV. The board decides by vote if there is any disagreement, suspected violation of the regulations or outside interference and is solely obliged to implement its decisions.

V. If a Galdosh does not like a majority decision, he/she has the right to call a Radosh. This is a battle between the Galdosh that begins at dawn the next day and ends at sunset. Fighters who are unable to fight at the end of Radosh have no vote, while each Galdosh has the right to put a Galnagh in his place. Also every Galdosh has the right not to participate in Radosh at all, thus losing his right to vote.

VI. The way natural factors influence the development of Vølrad must be respected by the council. If these factors force the delegates to end up in a tie, then the conflict of the tribe involved must end peacefully.

All contenders that have participated in and won at least one Vølrad bear the respected title of Voldosh and their fame is celebrated throughout the North.
