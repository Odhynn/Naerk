## Attack on the Monastery of Four Winds

When [[Band of Blood and Brimstone|four travelers]] climbed one morning to the top peak of [[Tarhelm]], they had no way of knowing that their actions would be the catalyst for a series of events far greater than themselves.

And this because in this towering area, surrounded by thick clouds, was the [[Four Winds Monastery|Monastery of the Four Winds]]. Î¤he nearby Cloud and Mist Giants until recently had been on friendly terms with the inhabitants of the monastery. However, their relations had intensified especially in the last period. And this because the giants had been placed under the command of [[Dumspergrond]], a mighty Titan, who by force was able to subjugate all the giant leaders, in the whole of Tarhelm. Anyone who challenged his authority fell dead. The monastery was one of the first targets, for its inhabitants could easily inform the valleys with magic and their huge birds of any expanding movement of the giants, and so it had to be out of the way quickly. Even more, Ralvia, the Queen of the Cloud Giants, knew that within the monastery were magical items and papyri of untold value that could help her and her warriors.

Thus, when the travelers found themselves at [[Queen Ralvia]]'s palace, she was already holding two monks captive and threatening to kill them unless the remaining inhabitants of the monastery handed over their leader, Mantissa, along with a respectable amount of magical items and scriptures. When the negotiations began, no one knew that these four travelers were the Band of Blood and Brimstone, who had proven their worth time and time again. Negotiations were going on and on and didn't seem to be going anywhere. Then, the four travelers made a particularly risky decision: They started running from the giants' camp, on the clouds, towards the entrance of the monastery.

However, the giants immediately responded, firing spears and arrows and causing one of the four, the massive orc undead also known as Domosan to turn and face them. The orc seemed to literally be buried under the arrows as he slaughtered Ralvia's guards, but he was finally able to reach her, and slashed her throat with his massive scythe, before passing out. The other three hid in the safety of the monastery, which housed about twenty residents.

The Giants' response was immediate. They killed the captives and began to besiege the monastery. Even worse, Golstrein, the Storm King, a towering giant from far away Hoen, appeared, perhaps by teleportation, and took it upon himself to lead the attack. Golstrein was the son of Thogodram Tronertefk, one of the leaders of the Defeated army, and was considered one of the most skilled warlords. And thus the attack on the monastery began. Fifty giants gathered, many on falcons, and fell from all sides on the monastery.

The ensuing battle was heard hundreds of miles away. A huge storm broke out over the monastery, and thunder and lightning fell all around the mountains. The monastery, in addition to Mantissa, had very powerful wizards and priests, among them Rikisol, who were able to support the defenders with powerful spells that summoned the elements of wind and snow. The temple hawks clashed with the giants' eagles, and the warriors on the ramparts undertook to prevent the giants from entering the inner court.

With heavy losses, the giants finally managed to break through. Gorstrein had reached the courtyard, where it looked as though he would win the battle, as those standing on their feet from the defenders could not stop him. Then, in a desperate effort, Droghor a Gnome of the Travelers, called upon the power of an ancient brass dragon, Hrondoshel, and managed to take his form. The dragon was over thirty yards long, and was able to kill Golstrein in the ensuing battle, with the remaining giants fleeing.

And just like that, the monastery of the four winds withstood the attack. The first battle against the army of giants had been won. More than that, however, this battle was to define how and when the invasion of Southern Darrok would begin. And no one doubts that if the opposing army had not been thus defeated, and had he lost a most able general, as well as much provision, he might have taken in the first days of the invasion at least half the plain as far as the southernmost towns, with disastrous consequences for the defense of the country.
