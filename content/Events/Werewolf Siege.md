[[Tas-Roch]] was built on four levels, one higher than the other, on a steep cliff, and quickly grew, with thick walls protecting it from attacking gnolls and werewolves. These attacks in the year 4765 became more and more frequent, resulting in a [[Werewolf Siege]] with the beasts gradually finding places in the wall rough enough to climb. The city's defense was getting harder and harder with many casualties, and food was running out.

Then a witch appeared, [[Angariel]]. Almost none of the residents knew about her, but she had somehow gotten inside the walls and convinced lord [[Slagis]] that she had the perfect plan to stop the attack. Werewolves had no control over their transformation: Most of them had acquired the disease from a bite, and after the first full moon they remained permanently in hybrid form, slaves to their most bestial instincts. Angariel offered them to stop the attack in exchange for giving them a potion with which they could gain control over their transformation.

Reactions to the witch's proposal were mixed. Some stopped the attack to think about it, since the disease was not their choice, some did not trust the witch and considered the proposal a trap, while the fanatical [[Warclaw]] of [[Karadosh]] believed that it was not a disease but a blessing, and their god wanted them to be in this form. Of course, everyone was hungry. To solve this problem, the witch suggested Slagis give the lower level of the city to the werewolves to stop further attacks and consider her proposal.

With a heavy heart, Slagis accepted the witch's offer and ushered the werewolves inside. He was heavily criticized by everyone, but deep down he knew he had no other choice. And just like that, he evacuated the inhabitants of the first level, collected what was valuable there, the gates opened and the werewolves, hesitant at first and then determined, entered the city, accompanied by their gnoll allies. And so, for a time there was a temporary truce while Angariel made the potion. Riots were a frequent occurrence and both sides began to lose patience. Armed riots were breaking out from the inhabitants, mostly those who had moved, who were trying to convince the lord to expel the werewolves once and for all with the army. At the same time, the werewolves on various occasions attacked weak points in the wall, and claimed that they had not signed any truce.

As [[Angariel]] prepared the potion, one of elven descent, also known as [[Taurlin]], appeared among the werewolves. He was among the strongest, and many respected his authority. And he said to the witch:

_"If that cures us, you have my word that I will call a truce. We will hold the first level and stop having visions for further areas in the city." He looked at the others around him, as if they were waiting for him to say something. "But if" and his eyes became the narrow slits of a predator "you fool us and this here doesn't work, then you have my word that there is no place you will feel safe in your life, no matter how much magic you do. You will be permanently hunted."_

And just like that, [[Taurlin]] grabbed the potion and drank first, followed by many others besides the [[Warclaw]]. Even the most prejudiced, when they saw Taurlin drinking, eventually succumbed to temptation. And indeed, those who drank returned to their original form without side effects.

The next week there was a full moon, and no one knew what would happen. The gates were closed, the guards doubled and all the doors barred. When the moon appeared in the sky, the werewolves, one after the other, began to growl and the city was filled with howls and howls. And this because the witch had, indeed, mocked them: The potion did cure the disease, and each could control his form, but with the full moon they all went mad: Some indulged in destructive fury, killing and butchering what they found, others they fell unconscious and started drooling, others started heading towards the witch's house as if hypnotized, until he was stopped by the gate guard, others took their hybrid form and started crawling on the roofs of the houses.

Chaos ensued. The gnolls and [[Warclaw]] took the opportunity to say they had to avenge the betrayal of their allies, and led an assault on the second level. At the same time Taurlin, who remained unaffected, began to secretly search for the witch, climbing and jumping through the wall. But the witch was missing. The ensuing battle was fierce, but the defenders soon gained the upper hand, as many werewolves were knocked out of the fight, while others in their rage turned on their own. Slagis issued a public proclamation saying that the witch had betrayed his trust and that she had run away as a wanted woman.

Gradually, by dawn, the attacks stopped as everyone realized [[Angariel]] was to blame. In reality, she had melted Veth crystals into her potion, causing different and unpredictable symptoms to appear in each patient. She herself thought it was a good experiment, and produced statistics with symptom rates, completely oblivious to the devastation she left behind. She headed north, Taurlin in tow. And the truth is that the werewolf kept his promise, and decided to hunt her with a group of twenty people until the end.

A truce again prevailed in the city, which gradually became constant. Werewolves and gnolls took the lower level permanently, while the gates opened. The lord decreed that there was no reason for any hostilities within seven miles of the city, to avoid further bloodshed, and the [[Warclaw]] limited their attacks outside the city, using a part of the lower level of [[Tas-Roch]] as their protected lair. As for the victims of the disease, some were gradually cured, some committed suicide, some emigrated, and several continued to react unpredictably and violently every full moon, causing residents to lock themselves in their homes and hide in fear during those nights.
