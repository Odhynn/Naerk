After the wizard [[Ylamir]] abandoned his outcast kin and forwarned the [[Daral]] elves of the coming invasion and their atrocities at [[Guldak]], the elves sent scouts. While the elves initially suspected him and captured him, their scouts quickly confirmed his words. Indeed, the atrocities the renegades had committed had been learned, while they had summoned other [[Asura]] and were heading for [[Volanir]].

The elves, pressed, conditionally freed Ylamir to help them. In a marsh before the forest, named [[Bladdar]], they gathered their forces and hid themselves, waiting for the army to appear. Their druids, aided by Ylamir, made the elves invisible: and the wizards with the Asura came dangerously close. By the time the first of them realized something was wrong, it was already too late: the cord had closed. The elves attacked from every direction, Ylamir had given them magic arrows that prevented the use of spells on anyone they nailed. A swarm of them fell upon the wizards, while wolf-shaped druids and armored warriors rushed to fight the Asura hand-to-hand. Ylamir wove deadly spells aimed at the strongest wizards, knowing their weaknesses all too well. Soon the attackers were found headless.

Most wizards were quickly put out of action, apart from a few who managed to use teleportation magic. But the Asura were many, and the losses of the elves were great. Ylamir quickly ran out of spells, and so did the druids, many of whom were badly wounded. [[Asura]] generally do not fear death and consider pain a pleasure, so they would fight to the death, at rates that quickly wore down even the bravest of warriors. Ylamir soon found himself trying to make arcane invocations to gain extra power, appealing to the [[Aspects]]. One by one they all ignored them, except for [[Fallfaunt]], who was far enough north to catch her attention. A Rusalka named [[Almefis]], her emissary, emerged from the waters and told him that she could help, but her intervention came at a cost. Ylamir hastily accepted it and she channeled her power through him.

He raised his hands and began chanting a powerful spell, his eyes turning blue. Frozen air rose up, and surrounded the entire satanic army. Within moments, all of them had turned into ice crystals, shattering as soon as the warriors hit them. The battle was over.

Ylamir was deified by the elves and welcomed into the city with all honors, though he soon left, never to return.
