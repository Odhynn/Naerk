The unethical (to some) acts that [[Rhekvethor]] had to do to create the [[Rod of Stone and Steel]] piqued the interest of many creatures, and they began to track his movements. Rhekvethor realized a major drawback of the rod: it could not leave [[Naerk]] and travel to other dimensions. This, though it troubled him, by no means prevented him from using it. He built [[Str√ºmeld]], a huge fortress of metal, as well as an underground labyrinth beneath it, and filled it all with silver sentry constructs. He then built a huge bridge, connecting the two sides of [[Roflar Strait]], to create the future cities of [[Sapurr]] and [[Flair]] at its shores.

Many had already been disturbed by his actions, but when Rhekvethor began to build a huge stone colossus, decisive action took place. The servants of Sigard, Yerastu, and Laerion found him while he was finishing the colossus and attacked him while he was busy with the ceremony. His associates, [[Tavethir]] and [[Salkor]], tried in vain to stop them, and all three were eventually captured. After a short talk, the servants of the gods of justice decided to judge them.

The trial that followed was called the Unnamed Judgment. As everyone involved there didn't want anyone else learning about Rod's immense power, they made sure that it wasn't archived and that no one else would learn of the events that took place there. Judges took charge of nine creatures. Four Archangels: [[Lo-Ukmasid]], [[Lu-Peng]], [[La-Vermenel]] and [[Li-Tithlamir]]. Three priests, one for each god, of whom the famous Hikari was the high priest of Yerastu. And two dragons, the brass Hrondoshel and a blue one, which remains unknown.

Tavethir was called first to confess his actions. Although initially hesitant, he eventually recounted the full timeline of events, leaving no doubt as to his truthfulness, incurring the wrath of Salkor and Rhekvethor. The two were summarily sentenced, and imprisoned in the bowels of the earth, with the help of the crystal dragon Menthdravor, who took over as their guardian. Rhekvethor was decided to be too dangerous to leave, and they decided to imprison him forever: As for Salkor, they decided to imprison him for five centuries, as he was not that dangerous in their eyes. Since then, those who learned about the trial have felt that it lacked objectivity, although some see this as reasonable given the circumstances.

The Moaning Diamond was detached from the rod and given to a tribe of Tarov subterranean creatures for safekeeping, while the rod was in a dimension that communicated only with the Tartars, in a deep place with a constant whirlwind protecting it. Tavethir was assigned to guard the only passage leading there from the material dimension, as a chance to atone for his actions, cursed to an eternity of duty. Finally, the four angels set their rings to be a key to the rod: so that even if someone passed through it, he could not use it. And the rings were given to the four corners of the horizon, in safe hands. As the millennia passed, everyone forgot about these events, and the few who knew the truth became fewer.
