These were a series of clashes lasting 14 years between the Sennarii and the [[Bjåglant|Bjåglanders]], who had just began colonizing the region before the Arrival and would not easily cede it to the newcomers.

Ατ the spring of the year 4798, [[Bjåglant]]'s raiders made their third large-scale raid on Sennarin in 8 years. Τhe first to be called upon to face them were the same ones who had fought them in the previous two raids: The Clans of Thunder. There were two main clans that had the largest part of the military power: the Are in the north and the Hida in the south. Originally, the Are had a much larger army, prestige and power, but they suffered from one basic problem: Lack of enough arable land. In many villages the villagers were starving.

The Are clan chose to deal with the Oni devils first, in an attempt to expand their lands northward. Most people disagreed with this move, as initially the threat of Bjåglant's barbarians was much more immediate, and most would rather face twenty humans, orcs or dwarves than one Oni. The battles with the Oni were over by the year 4793, but the cost was too heavy. The land they had won was disproportionately small compared to the cost in warrior lives. Among the people, a rumor began to circulate that the lord [[Are Shinzou]] was executing everyone who retreated from the battle with the Oni. Even worse, word got out that their main way of dealing with the problem of starvation was by sending the world to certain death and thereby reducing the number of mouths asking for food.

On the other hand, Lord [[Ishigaki]] of the Hida clan focused on meeting the needs of the people in the south. He strengthened trade and agriculture in order to be able to cover all the nutritional needs of the inhabitants. Soon, however, he was called upon to face Bjåglant's raiders alone: ​​Lord Shinzou refused his plea for help, saying that he too had not helped him in the battles against the Oni to the north. Hida then realized that things were difficult. His warriors numbered barely eight thousand, while his scouts on land and sea estimated Bjåglant's forces at many times that number.

The first two invasions were met with ambushes on rocks and reefs, as well as the aid of powerful wizards who could control the weather: one of them was Kworion, a renegade Cornuzel archmage who had sought refuge in the west. But the third raid, in the spring of 4798, was different. The Bjåglanders now knew what they were up against, and organized a superior plan. They sent twice as many ships as ever, nearly two hundred, which anchored in the river Draugrelfr without much loss from the skirmishes, but even this strong coastal force was only a distraction. The main body of their army had followed another, slower route, from the borders of the Harrowlands inland. This route was especially dangerous because of ghosts and Oni, but they had shamans who had communicated with spirits who would protect them for the days of their journey.

They attacked the northern border of the Clans of Thunder, in the south of Lord Shinzou, and began to plunder cities and villages. The resistance they met was meager, as the main body of his army was in the north, on yet another desperate campaign against the Oni. The two groups of barbarians joined at the headwaters of the [[Draugrelfr River]], and violently attacked Shinzou's army, who had managed to line up his army and recall about twelve thousand fighting men. But the barbarians numbered twenty thousand, and although the Are had the advantage of the ground, they were quite unprepared for the sudden charge that followed. The battle lasted many hours, with its result being inconclusive.

All this time, [[Ishigaki]] did not stand idly by. He gathered his army and burned the ships of the Bjåglanders, after slaughtering the meager defenses they had left behind. By the time he got to the battle, the tide had begun to tilt slightly in favor of the barbarians, but Lord Shinzou considered retreat cowardice and dishonor, so his warriors fought to the death. The Hida clan attacked the barbarians in the rear, and then, with renewed morale, the Are clan held their ground till the two bodies of the army joined: and by evening, nearly half the barbarians lay on the ground, dead or wounded: They retreated disorderly, and very few managed in the end to return to their country. Since then, everyone avoids the river, which is littered with skeletons and ghosts of barbarian warriors, even Ghost Ships, justifying the name Ghost River.

But Lord Hida had also suffered huge losses: Half of his warriors were dead or wounded. He did not hesitate to accuse Lord Ishigaki on the spot: That he had let the barbarians attack him without stopping them, and that his higher aim was to stage a coup d'état to take power into his own hands, now that he now possessed the largest army among to the Clans of Thunder.
