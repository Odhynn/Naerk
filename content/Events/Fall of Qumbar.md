At the start of the [[War of Karahath]], the [[Kenorex]] orc forces of [[Karahath]] attacked at night the city of [[Qumbar]], a strategic town near the western border of [[Oventhart]]. The attack of the [[Kambah]] army was very sudden, but the warriors of [[Qumbar]] were prepared. They manned the walls and took their predetermined positions, which they had learned after much training. In order for the attackers to reach the gate, they had to climb a hill by a winding road. In the final turn, the defenders unleashed successive volleys of arrows, which intercepted the head of the attack in a flash.

The valley below though was filled with enemies and they kept on coming. The defenders held their position for an hour or two, when disaster struck. [[Balgorin]], a renowned scout from the city, decided that resistance was futile and betrayed his people. He led the [[Kenorex]] forces towards the side entrance of the city. In the dark, it wasn't hard to mistake him for their own tracker. There was a very tall tree that had been struck by lightning and withered. He yelled at them to chip it so it would fall on the gate. By the time they did, he himself climbed up with a rope and began killing all the defenders on the walls. The picture was horrifying: In the confusion, it took the defenders a long time to understand what was happening, and even when they did, they were overcome with panic at the mere thought that [[Balgorin]], their best archer, had betrayed them.

On the walls, Balgorin shot arrows at anyone who moved. Soon, the tree fell and one by one, the Kenorex climbed the walls. He led them to the central square of the village, where the massacre began. The orcs started killing any locals who passed by, even civilians. Balgorin then realized, from their cries, that rumors of his betrayal had spread. He decided that these rumors had to be put to rest once and for all, or he would find himself in trouble from [[Oventhart]]. At the same time he wanted to make [[Kenorex]] trust him. He began to snipe all the officials in sight, and led the army into shelters and into the temples of the city. He showed no respect: He killed pregnant women, young children and old men. His face was a cold and expressionless mask.

Qumbar fell within three hours, and because of Balgorin's treachery it meant that the attack from both gates left no escape route for the inhabitants. The carnage took on colossal proportions and those who survived were few. The Kenorex trusted the traitor effortlessly. Balgorin became a captain in the city, responsible for maintaining order, while the Kenorex developed their forces to advance their advance on [[Unariel]] and [[Nador]].
