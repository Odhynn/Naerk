A devastating plague that struck the North. It caused constant pains in the stomach and vomiting, while the victim's blood turned black and polluted. This epidemic caused all the healers and magic users to go back and forth from tribe to tribe, thus strengthening their communication. Eventually the North grew stronger after the plague, albeit at great life loss.

It is said that this disease was caused from the mighty clash of [[Fraugmeneir]] and [[Vagur]], by the [[Linnorm Curse]].
