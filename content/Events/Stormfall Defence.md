After the pirates of Alagon started at year 3272 inhabiting [[Stormfall]], the natives started to prepare a major offensive. The villages of Zarketh and Grayser were the main target, as the main pirate ports. The elves attacked simultaneously with the bugbears, with the first attacking Zarketh and the later Grayser. The pirates were caught of guard and few managed to mount a defence. A few of them run straight for the ships, spreading panick to the rest of them. Only the first managed to escape, as those that delayed had noone to cover their retreat. Most of the pirates were slaughtered.

Those who managed got into their ships, but this only prolonged their suffering. At every disembarkation attempt, the elves awaited them with clouds of arrows, while the bugbears also had catapults with flaming missiles. Many more from Zarketh died there of dehydration as they rushed into the ships before taking on supplies. Those staying on Grayser faced the same problem, so they went to the smaller island to the west, also known as [[Karan's Cross]]. However, it could not sustain everyone who had come there. Thus, two hundred pirates remained, while all the rest left in ships, drawing lots. Of their 45 ships, only 12 made it to Alagon, and rumor has it that many of the survivors had stolen food from other ships to survive or had cannibalized corpses. Since then, pirates have not sent another expedition to Stormsfall, but the colony at Karan's Cross has been maintained, and exiled or condemned pirates have often been sent there.
