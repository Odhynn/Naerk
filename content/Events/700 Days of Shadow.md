A major calamity that took place in [[Whistor]], and its origin is still unknown. The whole country went into darkess and it is said that for 700 days the sun did not appear again. Undead and shadows in numbers showed everywhere and began to attack cities and villages. Massacres were taking place on a daily basis, and even in [[Sjemhe]] no one was safe. The creatures of darkness also attacked [[Almarica]], but the priests kept the darkness away from the city.

The Archbishop [[Felippe]] Sandiaz came into contact with the clergy of [[Sumril]] and [[Hansa]] and they agreed to a Holy Convocation in 4483. This Convocation, also known as the First Convocation of the Triad of [[Almarica]], took on a permanent character and was called [[Divinalis]]. The priesthoods agreed to act together to drive out the undead, protect the citizens, and safeguard the national sovereignty of [[Whistor]].

Based in Almarica, dozens of Divinalis orders began to emerge and spread across the country. They gathered the people, proclaiming the positions of the gods and the Convocation of [[Divinalis]], and created centers of self-government and defence in each settlement. The local priests, for the most part, agreed to join the orders, while those who refused were labeled heretics and friends of the pirates. The power of Divinalis was able to repel many raids, while a decisive battle was fought in Vhitu, where the invaders and the creatures of Darkness fled before the power of the clergy and the people and the first rays of light returned to the land, as the darkness was broken after powerful prayers. The final stop was the overthrow of the puppet king of [[Sjemhe]] and the establishment of a nomad as king who had the blessing of the Convocation. Thus, the 700 Days of Shadow came to an end.
