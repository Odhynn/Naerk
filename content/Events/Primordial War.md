*In the beginning, the world did not exist as we know it now. Time and space were concepts that held little or no meaning, until much later.*

In the beginning, there was the battle between [[primitive entities]]. The scale and duration of this cannot be defined, because even today we do not know how many participated and how long it lasted. In that early era the definition of being and dimension was blurred and all scenarios were possible, since we are talking about beings with unthinkable powers, knowledge and size. Most sages today accept the conclusion reached by the [[Skr√ªn|Council of the Five Sages of the North]], that at least twenty to thirty primordials fought and influenced the creation of Na'erk and the wider universe.

This battle didn't seem to come to a conclusion. It was doomed to last forever. However, at an indeterminate moment, an entity known as the [[Equalizer]] appeared. It created 4 other entities, of which 2 had volition and were **life** ([[Nahema]]) and **death** ([[Amehan]]) and the other 2 were mindless, **time** and **space** and these embodied the [[Material Plane]]. Somehow the battle passed into its second stage, where its effects began to crystallize in space and time, and the world, that was, space, then, began to take shape. The very essence of planets is matter that resulted from this battle, or at least from the part of the battle that occured with matter, because the dimensions of this conflict exceed our own perception of space-time. These four entities, although weaker than the other beings, were defined in a different dimension where the primordials could not destroy them. From this battle, those who later became known as the [[Elemental Lords]] slowly came to emerge more powerful.

That was the time when the War had first taken a form, which we can in an infantile way understand. Faint initial "rules" were imposed by the Balancer, to present the results of the battle in the material world, which is the first form of solidification of correlations in the War.
*"The crystallization of a confrontation between two or more Primitives was becoming tangible,"* as Velchor told the Council of the Five Sages of the North.
*"So the power of one Primitive, relative to the rest, crystallized in the material world,"* Arothal said.
*" It's still crystallizing, let's not forget the War continues,"* Chandor corrected.
*"Another element of War that began to manifest then is the ultimate price. Death."* added Raefibb.
*"Which in the case of Primitive entities means the cessation of existence, the nullification of force, and therefore the disappearance of its material existence."* Oracle is done.

The rules were simple, you win a battle and Nahema creates something to crystallize it, you lose and Amehan destroys something to crystallize it. Some of the outcomes of this battle were the planets, the [[Sun]], and [[Na'erk]]. E.g. when the Lord of Fire killed another Primordial who was certainly one of the most powerful, then Nahema took it upon herself to create the sun and Amehan took on the equally difficult job of destroying from the world all that illustrated power for the dead, for the which we know little about. And the Balancer decreed that only as a result of this battle could something appear in the material world.

Then the [[Veth|Pale Titan]] appeared, a Primal who sought to override and warp space and time and bend them to his will. Veth made a pact with Nahema, and created beings of his own that had many supernatural qualities. But this did not sit well with the Balancer, who intervened a second time in the world and killed Veth, and as a result of this battle, his corpse still exists, to serve as an example of what happens when someone breaks his rules. However, the creatures created by Veth were not destroyed, but remained in the material world, as a projection of the battle correlation fought by the elemental entities.

Thus the battle entered its third stage, where the Elemental Lords had gained the upper hand and prevailed over the rest. The rest, almost every other Primordial, joined forces against the Elemental Lords, even those who didn't want to be part of the battle, and at the same time the Elemental Lords allied with each other. The crystallizations of this battle were the meteor showers, and the attack on the elemental beings who were naturally on the side of the Elemental Lords. At the same time, the few beings and subordinates of the Primordials were trying to destroy the planets and elementals. But fate willed the Elemental Lords to win, and the planets endured.

However, the Equalizer now had a very good idea of what could happen if the battle of the Elemental Lords continued indefinitely. So he created the Elemental Ring, and gave it to them. Within it, they are free to fight as much as they want, but their balance would be decided on Na'erk, without their own direct intervention.
