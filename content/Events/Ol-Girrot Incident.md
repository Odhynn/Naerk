In the harbor of [[Ol-Girrot]] in the year 4105, a group of wizards were testing some [[Virryldians]] to see the limit of their abilities. They created a magical Portal and tried to activate the Virryldians within it. The result was a hole from the [[Shadow Plane]] to the [[Material Plane]]: Shadows and ghosts spread out from the torn fabric and possessed the bodies and souls of mages. A spell battle ensued with all the other wizards on the island to limit the damage that had been done.

The magical effects from both sides were very strong. Storms, fireballs, lightning and powerful enchantments. The island's port was completely destroyed, but the next day the [[Gatewatch]] were able to limit the damage to a small area and broke the link that connected the two dimensions. However, this area remained inaccessible and heavily guarded by members of Gatewatch till then.

After this incident, to prevent similar phenomena the Gatewatch created other constructs, similar to the Virryldians, the [[Varyas]]. These have a greater range and field of detection, and can be much more difficult to spot. Only certain magical items can control them, items that are directly controlled by their creators themselves. The main purpose of the Varyas is to identify Virryldians that are under third-party control or damaged, before they are used in any way that goes against their purpose.
