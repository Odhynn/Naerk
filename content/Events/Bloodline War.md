## Prelude

The conquest of the [[Vile Septet]] [[demons]] was stopped by the defensive barriers that the [[Demonslavers]] created. Fortunately for them, there was another way out. A thin strip of land connected [[Olgizmar]] to [[South Darrok]], a flat tidal expanse that at low tide barely became land and could be walked on for a few hours. But it also had many dangerous reefs, which made most ships except small boats avoid this passage at high tide.

The defensive wizard barriers were originally formed south of this point, but gradually with the battles they wizards retreated further north as the demons became impossible to contain. [[Darrok]] was watching the outcome of the battle and realized that sooner or later the demons would get there. So, they began to prepare defenses for this eventuality. They sent a thousand soldiers to the nearest town, [[Lamerpad]], to guard the crossing. The war in Almahr continued, and the time came when the demons gained access there.

The [[Demonslavers]] blamed Darrok's king for not sending help in time, but no general wanted to send an army there, only to be cut off from the sea and unable to return. At the same time, druids who studied the crossing concluded that only twice a day for an hour was the water shallow enough to walk across, and certainly not long enough for anyone to make the entire journey, let alone an entire army. So the warriors at [[Lamerpad]] waited, but they were sure they were in no danger. After two weeks, the threat was believed to have passed.

## Scouting Party

Apparently, the demons couldn't stop when the [[Demonslavers]] raised their magical defenses. After several failed attempts to penetrate them, they discovered this passage to the west. The first units, mostly flying and swift four-legged monsters, were sent to scout the opposite bank within days. The first thing they saw was the castle of [[Lamerpad]], as well as a vast farmland in the background, full of unarmed peasants. The scouts completely ignored the imminent flooding, as did Lamerpad's army and charged at the helpless people. Within moments they began to prey and eat on the defenseless inhabitants and their animals. The scouting mission was quickly forgotten in the face of raw brutality.

Lamerpad's army watched helplessly through the walls at the carnage. At last three mounted companies came out belatedly, and had to cover a vast area over which the demons were leaving scorched earth behind them. Worse yet, when the water level began to rise, these soldiers had fled several miles west, chasing the lone fragments of demons that had escaped into Darrok's hinterlands. Most of the demons that survived the fight hid in [[Greyleaf]] Forest, which was reputed to be haunted, so the soldiers were forced to turn back.

## Organized Assault

Reports were sent to [[Ekteron]] and [[Llykavann]], and only then the actual army mobilization towards Lamerpad began, albeit very late. Now everything was a race against time. The few [[demon]] scouts that returned were able to inform the demon lords [[Knaridzna]] and [[Mir'girra]] of what they found across the way. They in turn performed a demonic ceremony, which opened a passage to the [[Styx]]. Crimson icy spikes appeared along the route and froze the lowered sea level. Thus appeared a red corridor of ice, which was to be called [[Bloodline]].

The [[Bloodline]] didn't seem to back down, except at the highest levels: now, an entire army of demons could pass through. This time, tens of thousands of demons had gathered and were waiting. When the command was given, the ground resounded with the screams and shouts of the demonic army. Creatures small and large, with claws and weapons, with wings and thorns, rushed as one mass into this narrow corridor. Although thirsty for blood, [[Mir'girra]] had ordered them to ignore the farms and concentrate on Lamerpad.

## Siege

On the opposite side, the first reinforcements arrived slowly and delayed. There were now five thousand soldiers in the fortress, reinforced with a few priests from [[Nahema]]'s church in [[Ekteron]]. A black, shapeless mass was seen in the distance, walking on this red strip of land. Warriors deployed on the walls and priests invoked divine protection against the Abyss. A high priest summoned a ray of light, which appeared from heaven and burned the vanguard of the demons as it approached: But the main body passed the smoking carcasses and rushed upon the walls. Flying birds of the Abyss began to fly to the ramparts, and quickly swarms of arrows met them and took down several, with the remaining ones grabbing soldiers and throwing them down.

Ladders carried by demonic giants were placed at the base of the walls and the army began to climb up, some climbing the walls with thorns and claws. Then Mir'girra called fire upon the ramparts, which burned several dozen warriors, and when the smoke cleared the first demons had climbed. The gaps of the fallen were covered by the second line, while a wall of ice from a mage stopped the demons' attempt to surround them. The battle was fierce, but some priests had taken care to bring white steel lances and consecrated arrows from the Temple, which the archers hurled from the towers above. Faced with heavy casualties, the demons were forced to retreat. Sparkles and hot light followed them, with a young elf wizard organizing the defense.

The next attempt had a similar outcome. The defenders' biggest losses were from Mir'girra's spells and when some demon dogs climbed up, and began beaming down, killing warriors in the back. The defense held, however, and after a few hours the demons were forced to retreat from Bloodline, staining it with their own demonic blood. More arrows and spells fell in their wake, while some offered to pursue them. However, the elf wizard, named Ildish, called out to them to brace themselves: This would not be the last attack.



Just two days after the siege of Lamerpad, a council of war was held to decide Darrok's next move. This included among others the Reina of Lamerpad, Ildish, who had been reduced to a general, Olken, an emissary of the king of Darrok, and Taira, High Priestess of Nahema. However, Olken had been killed by demons on the road from Ilykavann and had been taken in his form by the sorcerer Molroth of the Septet. As a consequence, the demons knew Darrok's every move.

Although Reina wanted the defenses on Lamerpad to be strengthened, Taira was convinced that their forces should fight back, waging holy war on the demons of Pyrlon. Molroth, in his Olken form, encouraged this initiative, while Ildish who was hesitant at first, called his forces to Lamerpad but was in no rush to follow Taira to Bloodline.

Most soldiers initially considered the mission to Bloodline suicide. But Nahema's church had enormous power in the country and the response of the people was surprisingly great, especially after the news of the Lamerpad attack spread. Many people had lost relatives and thirsted for revenge, while the successful defense of the fortress gave them optimism for the coming battles. Thus, within a month, a huge expeditionary force was assembled and equipped, consisting of mostly inexperienced villagers and clergy, which was equipped and trained hastily, without an organized plan.

But the zeal of the faithful was to be a factor that even the demons had not foreseen. More than sixty thousand had been gathered in a few weeks, and several of them had been equipped with sanctified steel. Priests had entered at the head of every company and division, and when they reached Lamerpad, they found that it could not accommodate them, and many camped outside on the wet plain. Fai was limited, so this expeditionary force quickly continued towards the bloodline, led by Taira.

[[Ildish]] summoned cavalry from Ekteron, even dwarves from Talhad, but refused to follow Taira in such a risky plan. He strengthened Lamerpad's defenses and tried to organize supply caravans, which could solve the ever-growing supply and equipment problem. Molroth had already conveyed all this information to the demon camp when one day a second emissary of the king arrived and only then did it become clear that Olken was not who he seemed. Ildish tried to grab him but Molroth dodged it and started flying towards Olgizmar. The general summoned a pegasus and began chasing him through the air, when an arrow struck the wizard in the leg and knocked him off balance. Ildish's sword to finish him off with a lightning strike. The well-aimed archer was Kandir Leafwisperer, an archer from the Monastery of the Four Winds, who had come to defend the fortress. He climbed into Ildish's carriage and they flew desperately to Bloodline, to catch up with the evil.

However, the damage was already done: The expeditionary force was walking into a trap from which it was impossible to escape. Alzagur, the alchemist of the Vile Septet melted the ice on either side of the Bloodline and water began to flow again, cutting the corridor and the faithful in two. The frozen water was not deep enough, but it had a reddish color that poisoned those it touched. The advance body found itself trapped in the east, while out of the water emerged Erth'rach, the huntress of Styx, along with a company of four-legged amphibious demons who ran and slaughtered all who had been poisoned by the water and were unable to defend themselves.

But the priests were not idle: They were able with their own magic to stop the advance of the water and organize their defense, but their rearguard was no longer able to help. Unable to turn back, they continued forward, and on their way found the forces of Knaridzna together with Thegmeden, arrayed on the first hills of Olgizmar with the advantage of the terrain. Demons of every possible size and shape, strategically placed.

But they had underestimated the zeal of the faithful and the Taira. Nahema's power was like a light in their banners and hearts that could not be extinguished by the Abyss. Simple villagers and soldiers, they rushed at the demons with a self-denial that only faith in their cause could give them. At first the demons started throwing fire and lightning at them, laughing at the destruction they were causing, but when the worshipers arrived they changed their minds. Even teenagers with spears rushed into the demon lines and inflicted massive casualties. In the midst of it all, priests summoned divine shields that shielded the projectiles or extinguished them in the air, while many raised the wounded with powerful healing spells. Soon the demons' terrain advantage was nullified in a massive hand-to-hand battle, in which the demons suffered massive losses.

But soon the faithful got tired, after a difficult route and an even more difficult climb. It was then that Erth'rach with her beasts reached the lines of the Faithful that had remained on the beach and began to cut into their flanks like pincers. Most of the priests had gone to the front, leaving those behind vulnerable. The beach was stained crimson with blood as the beasts maimed and tortured the wounded, dead and alive indiscriminately.

It was then that Mir'girra, the general of the Abyss, appeared in the battle, at its most critical point, with reinforcements. Flying beasts descended upon the priests, and armored demon soldiers filled the gaps in the hills' defenses. The priests' spells were nearly finished, and Mir'girra slaughtered Taira, who was locked in battle with Knaridzna's bodyguard. Soon, demons had surrounded the believers from every possible direction and were decimating them.

[[Ildish]] and [[Kandir]] arrived very late. Thousands of warriors were dead, and the chance of breaking the demonic cord on the hills seemed non-existent. They began killing the Styx monsters and soon an escape route was created to the rear. The few survivors began to retreat, but the demons' counterattack was fierce. As soon as Kandir, with one well-placed shot, killed Erth'rach, her powers seemed to be momentarily disorganized. With tooth and nail, they managed to mount a defense at the narrowest point of the Bloodline and those who could run fled, many leaving their fellow warriors behind, with demons above them sadistically torturing them. There were not a few priests who stayed behind to protect the wounded, in the doctrine of Nahema, as a result of which they sacrificed themselves.

The demons began to advance towards the Bloodline when the heavens opened and two huge angelic figures appeared. the Golden Emissaries La-Vermenel and Nalsar. Nalshar had heard Taira's last wailing cry and had come from the Golden Palace, bringing with him La-Vermenel from the Fortress of the Just. The two held the pass, fighting all the beasts that came and killing them with their shining swords and divine magic. Their presence blinded anyone nearby and with their intervention the survivors of the battle safely crossed the Bloodline and returned to Lamerpad.

However, this intervention was not without cost. Surrounded by huge demons, La-Vermenel fell down and Thegmeden wrapped him in barbed nets that had a powerful poison. Knaridzna took the lucky shot, with Nalshar unable to help as he too was fighting Mir'girra's guards. The archangel's death became a massive explosion that sent Nalshar back to the celestial realms, unleashed most of the demons, and melted the ice of the Bloodline, sending the thin strip of land under the sea, and cutting Olgizmar off from Darrok for good. Water covered the entire battlefield and sent the dead under the waves, which had turned crimson. No one since has dared to approach this point, for many decades.
