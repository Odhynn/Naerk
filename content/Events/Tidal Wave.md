In the year 4712, a huge wave swept the shores of [[Kelonarie]] and the [[Raene Isles]]. It was over eighty feet in height, and wreaked havoc on harbors and coastal towns, even in [[Jilakasa]]. The victims were many, while for several months no one knew what caused it. At some point a pirate, also known as the Black Seagull, appeared and told his side of the story although many held their doubts, knowing what a liar the [[Black Seagull]] was.

He was sailing his ship far to the east, to the islands beyond [[Sigdar]], when the weather suddenly worsen. The wind carried him into deep water, and soon he was in the open ocean, in the [[Whalelands]]. The bad weather gradually turned into a storm, and dark clouds filled the sky. Land was nowhere to be seen and the boat bobbed up and down the waves like a nut shell. And gradually the weather phenomena resembled a cyclone.

There were not a few times that the boat almost sank, while most of the sailors who had not drifted away were tied with ropes and used buckets to remove the water. But Black Seagull was an experienced captain and the ship kept afloat. Then, as he approached the eye of the cyclone, he saw a terrifying sight: Huge tentacles were flying out of the sea, and they seemed to be striking the sea water with force. Each tentacle was thicker than the ship, and was hundreds of feet long. The pirate had seen a [[Kraken]] before, but any such creature looked like a piece of cake in front of this monstrosity.

A tentacle lifted the whole ship into the air, and then the sailors knew for sure that they were lost. From up there, however, they saw something even more terrifying: A huge creature, with huge teeth and many rows of eyes, was trying to come to the surface. No one could tell exactly how big it was, but from this high the ship looked like it would fit comfortably in his mouth. The tentacles came down hard on this strange creature, and it in turn began biting and ripping the tentacles off, in a battle of epic proportions.

With every splash and movement, tidal waves rose up. But, high in the air, the sailors were safe. The battle lasted an indeterminate amount of time, and the tentacles gradually wrapped the creature together and dragged it back into the abyss. This sank, letting out a hideous howl, which drove many of the remaining pirates mad, who began to thrash about on deck. When the storm died down, the remaining tentacle left the ship in the sea and it too disappeared.

According to Black Gull, the tentacles were [[Jalerk]] and she protected them from something that was [[Yast|from another world]]. Of course, each pirate later interpreted the story differently, and the facts remain unreliable. But other ships had also seen the cyclone and heard the howling at the end, therefore, willingly or not, this story took on dimensions. And more and more people began to be in awe of Jalerk and the mysterious creatures of the ocean, which are best left alone. As for the more wise, they believed that Jalerk protected the [[Material Plane]] from some otherworldly colossal creature, but few took them seriously. In the end, for most, Jalerk was one and the same.
