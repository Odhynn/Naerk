[[Kambah]], upon learning of the [[Green Hills Withdrawal]] from [[Palaurim]], quickly realized that a power gap had been created that could be exploited to the south. [[Tarthyn]] was a region with few defenses and although it maintained good relations with the Green Hills, it did not have enough warriors to protect it. Thus, the Kenorex organized a campaign to the south, which had been in preparation for several months, since the end of the year 4818.

There was no shortage of ships and warriors: after the [[Battle of Misty Sea]], it had absolute superiority at sea in the northeastern regions. In early summer, hundreds of ships, warships and transports were seen off the coast of [[Silkwin]]. The city bells rang as soldiers and priests began to gather on the ramparts, but it was already too late. Hordes of warriors descended around the city and began slaughtering anyone they found.

[[King Odern]] ordered the gates and hatches to be closed so that they could not enter. Those inside the walls witnessed horrific massacres and torture of those who had been shut out: The invaders seized villagers and soldiers one by one and tortured or beat them in public, calling on their friends and relatives to open the gates. Some such attempts from the inside were stopped in time, and Odern tried to negotiate the fate of the captives, but quickly realized that he had no bargaining chips.

The siege equipment was ready that night, as many pieces simply had to be carried from the ships, as they were already assembled. The city was within range of the catapults from [[Kambah]]'s massive ships, and they soon began to fire missiles coated in fires from [[Hell]] itself. They exploded and burned everything, ignoring even the defenses from the priests of the [[Luminous Order]]. Some projectiles even released devils from within when they exploded, resembling flaming felines. These beasts fell upon the defenders and maimed scores of them before the priests and knights of the Order killed them or chased them back to Hell.

The first ladders were secured on the side of the harbor walls, and the warriors began to climb. Boiling oil and divine invocations greeted them, halting their progress, but this was a temporary respite. Heavily armored orcs reached the ramparts, ignoring the arrows. Leading the charge was a massive ironclad warrior, [[Nolgor]] Dalx, who was a Hellspawn. He jumped onto the walls and started running, trampling archers and knocking them off the walls. His armor was riddled with arrows but he seemed unstoppable.

Between the defenders was a half-orc warrior from the [[Luminous Sword]] named [[Grok]]. Nolgor threw him away but he rose and began to strike at him with his iron fists, glowing with divine magic. Nolgor struck him in the chest with his hammer, but Grok answered with blows that rang through the fiendish soldier's armaments. A guard jumped at him from behind and tried to knock him down, but was injured by the violently swinging steel spikes of his helmet. Nolgor turned and melted his head with his boot. Then Grok found time and started throwing repeated punches at Nolgor, bringing him to his knees. With a sudden movement, however, he struck his jaw with the hammer and flung the devotee away. Nolgor rushed to finish him off but suddenly a huge wall of fire appeared in front of him. He ran into it and emerged unscathed, only to see a collapsed part of the wall in front of him. He roared and continued to walk in the void as he understood the illusion. A gnome mage had taken up position behind Grok and was delaying him with deceptive spells. Grok was down though, so he made him invisible with one spell and with a second they jumped to the opposite tower.

Soon, the spot Nolgor had cleared was filled with [[Kenorex]] warriors. After they established a foothold, they tried to advance to the first building block, but were greeted by a shower of arrows and divine fire and were forced to stop. But the outer wall had fallen, and the warriors began to gather there, taking cover from the surrounding towers. As night began to fall, hostilities ceased, but the Kenorex would not let the inhabitants rest and mourn their dead. Unearthly screams from hideous creatures broke the silence of the night, along with occasional catapult shots.

The next morning the [[Kambah]] army stopped the attacks. [[Rongerak]] and his entourage appeared in front of the South Gate of the main city with a white flag, ready for negotiations. Very quickly, Odern with his own entourage and [[Grok]] came down to meet him. Rongerak gave him two options, ignoring the murderous glares the king was giving him. Either he would surrender the city, and take his word that he would not continue on to the rest of Tarthyn, or he would grant him all the territory north of Lake [[Tartha]], the [[Pinewoods]] and west of [[Silkwin]]. In each case he pledged to release the captives and return the bodies of the dead, to ensure that the king would agree to negotiate.

Odern found it particularly difficult to answer. Rongerak gave him a day's notice, for he knew he was in danger of [[Green Hills]]' forces coming to their aid. Either he would lose nearly a fifth of his country, or the capital, which was a center of trade and industry, a strong defensive barrier, and seat of the crown. He asked his advisors, and with the exception of one druid and some lords who owned land to the west, most agreed that it was best to save the city. Odern with a heavy heart gave his answer to the Tyrrant, and the next day the siege ended and the captives returned to their families.

Messengers and pigeons carried the news everywhere. Each inhabitant, and each lord was called upon within a few days to choose: Either leave their land and possessions and begin their life anew in the south and east, or stay and suffer the tyrannical yoke of [[Kambah]]. For many villagers, this was not even an option: They were forced to stay as they neither had the means to leave nor could they leave their animals. For some lords, the choice was even more obvious, as they had vast riches to lose, and they hated Odern for selling them out so easily. For others, who had seen atrocities from the [[Kenorex]], the path of exile seemed better.

Huge caravans of emigrants formed, heading first south and then some east, past the [[Pinewoods]]. Kenorex arrived within days in all areas, but left those who wished to leave unmolested. They installed in all the towers and all the castles their own army, and any lord who refused them entrance they punished him exemplarily, calling [[devils]] to invade his tower. The lords were either replaced or forced to have a Kambah advisor by their side, to ensure their absolute obedience to the Stone Throne of [[Aar]].

But those who thought that the yoke would be unbearable, fell out in their expectations. For most peasants, taxation remained roughly the same as before, while the arbitrariness of some lords, who until recently could raise taxes unchecked, was brought to a violent halt. The Kenorex army built ramparts and some redoubts to the south to make sure there would be no counterattack, but Tarthyn, having already taken a massive blow, was unable to respond. The Kenorex took precautions to limit the mistreatment of the villagers, so that there was no talk of rebellion within the occupied area. And once more, the strategic mastermind of Rongerak was imminent, who with only one day's fighting and little losses of his forces, succeeded in annexing a vast fertile tract of land to [[Kambah]]'s territory.
