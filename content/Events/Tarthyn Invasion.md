Kambah, upon learning of the [[Green Hills Withdrawal]] from [[Palaurim]], quickly realized that a power gap had been created that could be exploited to the south. [[Tarthyn]] was a region with few defenses and although it maintained good relations with the Green Hills, it did not have enough warriors to protect it. Thus, the Kenorex organized a campaign to the south, which had been in preparation for several months, since the end of the year 4818.

There was no shortage of ships and warriors: after the [[Battle of Misty Sea]], it had absolute superiority at sea in the northeastern regions. In early summer, hundreds of ships, warships and transports, were seen off the coast of [[Silkwin]]. The city bells rang and soldiers and priests began to gather on the ramparts, but it was already too late. Hordes of warriors descended around the city and began slaughtering anyone they found.

King Odern ordered the gates and hatches to be closed so that they could not enter. Those inside the walls witnessed horrific massacres and torture of those who had been shut out: The invaders seized villagers and soldiers one by one and tortured or beat them in public, calling on their friends and relatives to open the gates. Some such attempts from the inside were stopped in time, and Odern tried to negotiate the fate of the captives, but quickly realized that he had no bargaining chips.

The siege equipment was ready that night, as many pieces simply had to be carried from the ships, as they were already assembled. The city was within range of the catapults from Kambah's massive ships, and they soon began to fire missiles that had fires from Hell itself. They exploded and burned everything, ignoring even the defenses from the priests of the Luminous Order. Some projectiles even released devils from within when they exploded, resembling flaming felines. These beasts fell upon the defenders and took scores before the priests and knights of the Order killed them or chased them back to Hell.

The first ladders were secured on the side of the harbor walls, and the warriors began to climb. Boiling oil and invocations greeted them, halting their progress, but this was a temporary respite. Heavily armored orcs reached the ramparts, ignoring the arrows. Leading the charge was a massive ironclad hammer warrior, Nolgor Dalx, who was a Hellspawn. He jumped onto the walls and started running, trampling archers and knocking them off the walls. His armor was riddled with arrows but he seemed unstoppable.

Opposite was a half-orc warrior from the Luminous Sword named Grok. Nolgor threw him away but he rose and began to strike at him with his iron fists, glowing with divine magic. Nolgor struck him in the chest with his hammer, but Grok answered with blows that rang through the fiendish soldier's panoply. A guard jumped at him from behind and tried to knock him down, but was injured by the violently swinging steel spikes of his helmet. Nolgor turned and melted his head with his boot.

But Grok found time and started throwing repeated punches at Nolgor, bringing him to his knees. With a sudden movement, however, he struck his jaw with the hammer and flung the worshiper away. Nolgor rushed to finish him off but suddenly a huge wall of fire appeared in front of him. He ran into it and emerged unscathed, only to see a collapsed wall in front of him. He roared and continued to walk in the void as I understood the illusions. A gnome mage had taken up position behind Grok and was delaying him with deceptive spells. Grok was down though, so he made him invisible with one spell and with a second they jumped to the opposite tower.
