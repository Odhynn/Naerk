A huge battle that was fought when the [[Defeated Army|army]] of Karahath invaded [[Green Hills]]. With the help of [[Imtaria]] and [[Emperor Rokfilar III]], the army of Green Hills led by King eventually overwhelmed the northern armies, when they were tricked into making a reckless charge. A storm of arrows killed many goblins, including [[Gorbla]]. The orcs were surrounded and slaughtered, with only a few surviving. During the fight, [[King Morran IV]] was critically injured by the serrated blade of [[Petch-cro-Bor]] and subsequently died two weeks after. The giant king, [[King Thogodram|Thogodram]], was disappeared in a deafening thunderstike that killed numerous soldiers from both sides.

Afterwards, the cataphracts and [[Palaurim]] knights organised a chase to the retreating orcs, but the giants and trolls, led by [[Hoberkorra]] stopped them and the defeated army safely reached [[Paraselt]].
