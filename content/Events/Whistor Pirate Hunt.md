A series of three naval battles where the organized [[Whistor]] fleet of [[King Raldon]] chased the pirate ships and destroyed them. The pirates fled to [[Ngamui Isles]], as [[Whistor]] victories were overwhelming. For every galley lost, the pirates lost twenty-seven times as many schooners and ships.

The pirates quickly fled in the face of constant danger of overwhelming defeat, while [[Whistor]]'s galleys soon accompanied all major trade routes. Raldon took an active part in all the naval battles with his flagship and his two sons.

## Aftermath

Within a year and a huge power gap in [[Whistor]], the pirates, under Captain [[Valus]], attacked again on [[Malgoryn]] with success.
