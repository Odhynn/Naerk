The arrogance of a circle of powerful wizards, in the 39th century, that tried to rival the gods and resulted in the near-dissolution of all semblance of balance in [[Naerk]].

They used an artifact that had the ability to copy the magic of any other object and be able to call upon its power at a later point in time. The greater the power of this, the less time it could be utilised, and this was the [[Quicksilver Sphere]]. They modified the artifact to be able to copy multiple objects at once and managed to copy the [[Malgyra]] undetected after intelligence gathering and espionage. Then they locked themselves in their tower and tried with the [[Malgyra]] powers to make a universe of their own, a world in which they would be the gods. But this action resulted in the Malgyra being dislodged and thrown into the outer circle of the [[Elemental Ring]]. This also marked the beginning of the war between the Elemental [[Lords]]. [[Yerastu]] in retaliation to the mortals burned down the wizard circle, the Quicksilver Sphere, and the young universe that had begun to be born within the tower, while the location of the tower and what remains inside, or even if it still exists, remains unknown.
