In the year 4741, on the plains of [[Marelthia]], three skeletons appeared, seemingly from the middle of the plain. No one paid much attention: According to old stories, every decade an undead appeared every now and then, like a remnant of the ancient empire of [[Zulhan]] and its fall. Five villagers with rakes and pitchforks were sent and reduced the undead to dust and crumbs. Stories were circulated of their bravery, and the bones were distributed throughout the village of [[Kalyr]], which was west of the city of [[Sandling]], as charms and as souvenirs.

Two weeks later, a hunter spotted more skeletons. There were at least ten of them, and they were heading towards Kalyr, as if they knew its location. The hunter tried with voices to direct them elsewhere, but they paid no attention to him and continued on their way. This time, the residents called the village guard, thirty experienced warriors, and ten volunteer villagers also came. Following the instructions of Keldar Hayrill, the Windfolk leader of the guard, they led the skeletons to a barricade of stones. There they surrounded them and began to neutralize them one by one. They were able to break them all with only one wounded villager, but none of them considered themselves victorious, because they knew there would be more. Most were shadowed in the village. A messenger was sent to carry the news to Lord Tergon of Sandling, who did not seem particularly troubled by the news.

Not four days had passed when an army of a hundred skeletons appeared on the horizon. This was what everyone in Kalyr feared: No one laughed anymore, the stories had stopped and with grim faces they prepared for battle. Again an emissary went to Sandling, but no help would arrive in the village in time. After some discussion, Keldar ordered all the civilians locked in their houses, and brought all the rest up to the roofs of the first houses. He gave the village's ten horses to a group of guards, and ordered them to wait to attack where needed.

Even from a distance, it was obvious that this group of skeletons was not like the others. Most had bronze armor fittings, brandishing curved swords, shields and spears from a forgotten age. And when they got close to Kalyr, they started running. Not a few villagers threw down their rakes and started running back, and they were the first victims. The garrison managed to hold a line of defense on the rooftops, breaking the arms that tried to climb, but the half skeletons poured into the alleys and easily scaled the makeshift ledges. The horsemen made a charge which repulsed one party, but when three fell wounded by the weapons of the dead, the rest were forced to halt to protect them.

With his lance, Keldar kept the skeletons at bay. He had five experienced warriors with shields and clubs guarding his back, and they had managed to destroy several skeletons. It wasn't long, however, when on the nearby rooftop a soldier was maimed by a sword and the skeletons took the opportunity to climb up and attack the rest. Without hesitation, Keldar took off and jumped onto the roof with the help of his weapon. He cut down two skeletons that had climbed up with a horizontal strike and knocked down a wooden awning on a third, blocking access.

Now the battle was disorderly and chaotic. The line of defense broke into several small skirmishes: and Keldar found it manageable, given his own capabilities. He took three horsemen, mounted a horse, and surrounded the skeletons in the first lane, where they destroyed them to the last. They repeated the same in the other alleys, but their losses were significant. By the time the last fell in the penultimate alley, four guards and three villagers had fallen heavily wounded.

In the last line of defense, among the skeletons, appeared their general: a noblewoman, with rotting skin and golden armlets and armor. At her feet lay two guards dead, cut in two by a curved sword she held: She had caught a peasant, and his skin was turning gray by degrees, until she let him fall, the life drained from him. Everyone around her was turning away from her, while some were throwing their weapons and running screaming. Keldar knew some rudimentary spells, but he knew he was screwed.

He swept horizontally with his weapon and broke through a skeleton and charged at her, but his blade didn't go more than a point into her hand. His next strike found her in the armor, and by then she was close and went to grab him. Keldar grunted an evasion spell and his form became ethereal for a moment. He dodged and dodged it, but then he saw the sword coming at him. He managed to fend it off with the handle, but the wood creaked and he wouldn't last much longer. He bent down and brought the gun down backwards, aiming for her leg. She wasn't quick enough: The groomer hit her in the ankle and her rotten leg gave way. She fell down with her jewelry jingling.

But he had focused on her for a long time, and he had lost touch with what was happening around him: A skeleton jumped on him and knocked him down too. She began to tear off his clothes and chest and took out a knife to impale him. Cursing his luck, Keldar blocked the blow with a magical shield and caught his weapon from low. He put weight and melted the skeleton's head between a threshold and his blade. The noblewoman had risen to one knee, while two skeletons with armor and spears surrounded her.

Then a black and white lynx appeared from a roof, and jumped on them. As he fell, he swept them to the side, followed by a lightsaber from a newly arrived warrior, cutting off their heads in one fell swoop. The general went to weave a spell, but it didn't seem to catch: the warrior swung his sword, which glowed with an orange light, and cut off her hands. His last blow pierced her breast, and with a scream that pierced them all she crumbled to dust, her gold falling to the ground.

The stranger turned towards him, while the lynx came to his side. He was swarthy and wore desert clothing, but inside was silver carved armor, and he had a round shield on his back. He walked up to him and gave him his hand to stand up, his eyes glowing crimson. _"My name is Teeso, and... we need to talk."_
