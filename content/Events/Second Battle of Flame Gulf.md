Although the defeat of the [[First Battle of Flame Gulf]] was not decisive, the Sultan's reputation as [[Markesh]]'s largest naval force had irreparably suffered. He gathered his fleet and sent it to Dzultar to level it, and the [[Dzultar]] admiral waited him on [[Nolgot]] island.

His ships appeared unexpectedly at night behind a cape and rammed the [[Hoarinhel]] galleys, numbering over two hundred. The answer was immediate, but the magicians flying fires and the ballists had no clear target, so there was unintentional losses. The first twenty galleys, along with Dzultar's forty ships were quickly wrapped in flames. Soon a wall of burning inferno was created by flaming ships that prevented the two sides from continuing the battle: Neither side wanted to send there the rest of its ships, and the danger of more ships to be rammed was not to be underestimated, since Visibility was limited with ash, smoke and darkness. Both sides retreated.
