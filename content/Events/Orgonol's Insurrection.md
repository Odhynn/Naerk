Shortly after [[Orgonol]] argued with [[Sergonial]] about the tortured souls in [[Hell]], he went to the Pit and freed all the souls that were there. All Hell was after him, but he did accomplish his mission. When he finally succeeded he took these souls to [[Yerastu]], who hated him more than anyone but recognized that he was the best to judge what would happen to them in [[Tailway]]. Yerastu in return gave him a place in the [[Fortress of the Just]] to serve justice.
