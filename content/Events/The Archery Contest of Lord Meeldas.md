Traditionally, in [[Vaensir]], the capital of the island of [[Tol-Gera]], every spring the king hosts a huge feast with hundreds of guests. Merchants, priests, wizards, feudal lords, diplomats, princes and captains all respond to his call, to gain political influence, to close financial deals, to learn the news of the islands and to taste some unique tastes in food, sweets and drinks. The celebrations often lasts even four consecutive days, and often during its duration there are shows with magicians, jugglers, jugglers, wild animals and beasts, jousting, archery and more.

The year 4816, however, was to be special: The eccentric Lord [[Meeldas]] proclaimed that he would hold the greatest archery match [[Tol-Gera]] had ever seen, as he was a great fan of the sport. Invitations were sent out to all the neighboring lands, from [[Imtaria]] to the [[Green Hills]], and from [[South Darrok]] to [[Oromil]]. And as an incentive, the king announced that he would give a bigger prize than ever to the winner: The hand of his only [[Veronica|daughter]].

As expected, his noble advisers were quick to persuade him. But his decision was unwavering, and within a few days letters came from many regions that their best archers were on their way. Too many had been lulled into the idea that they could become the future heir to the throne with a few well-placed shots. Meeldas laid out the rules of the contest: He would place 10 apricots on poles, almost perpendicular to each other, ten yards apart. He who would hit all of them from the starting point with the fewest arrows, a maximum of nine, within three days, would marry him to his daughter. Everyone had only one chance.

The feast and refreshments were prepared with all the necessary luxuries and comforts, and gradually the guests began to arrive. The competition began, and one after the other, the would-be kings began to try their luck one after the other. It quickly became apparent that the challenge was very difficult. The best archers on the first day needed 13 and 14 arrows. Even hitting an apricot with an arrow was difficult, as 90 and 100 yards often required multiple shots.

On the second day an elf from Oventhart appeared, named Aeluril. Several people were scared when they saw him, because he was dirty and worn out, and he had forest camouflage on. Ignoring the characterizations against him, he took his bow and with the first shot he hit the first two apricots. With each subsequent shot, it dropped the next fruit. For the 100 yards he took his time, calculated the wind and the distance, and shot his arrow, which tore the apricot in two.

Somehow, this mysterious wood elf became the best candidate, and he retired to his corner, drinking some wine and waiting for the result to be announced. But the competition was not over. On the second day, several talents appeared, including several who wanted to compete with crossbow or javelin, but their wish was not accepted. However, some archers were able to complete their efforts with eleven and ten arrows.

That same evening, a mysterious wayang named Silien was able to hit the third and fourth apricot with one arrow, drawing Aeluril. However, his 100-yard shot had barely scratched the apricot, although because he had thrown it it technically counted. In the event of a tie for the best, another test had to be set. The king faced the very real possibility of acquiring a particularly undesirable son-in-law, according to his advisers. He himself was completely divided.
