Traditionally, in [[Vaensir]], the capital of the island of [[Tol-Gera]], every spring the king hosts a huge feast with hundreds of guests. Merchants, priests, wizards, feudal lords, diplomats, princes and captains all respond to his call, to gain political influence, to close financial deals, to learn the news of the islands and to taste some unique tastes in food, sweets and drinks. The celebrations often lasts even four consecutive days, and often during its duration there are shows with magicians, jugglers, jugglers, wild animals and beasts, jousting, archery and more.

The year 4816, however, was to be special: The eccentric Lord [[Meeldas]] proclaimed that he would hold the greatest archery match [[Tol-Gera]] had ever seen, as he was a great fan of the sport. Invitations were sent out to all the neighboring lands, from [[Imtaria]] to the [[Green Hills]], and from [[South Darrok]] to [[Oromil]]. And as an incentive, the king announced that he would give a bigger prize than ever to the winner: The hand of his only [[Veronica|daughter]].

As expected, his noble advisors were quick to dissuade him. But his decision was unwavering, and within a few days letters came from many regions that their best archers were on their way. Too many had been lulled into the idea that they could become the future heir to the island's rule with a few well-placed shots. Meeldas laid out the rules of the contest: He would place 10 apricots on poles, almost perpendicular to each other, ten yards apart. He who would hit all of them from the starting point with the fewest arrows, a maximum of nine, within three days, would marry him to his daughter. Everyone had only one chance.

The feast and refreshments were prepared with all the necessary luxuries and comforts, and gradually the guests began to arrive. The competition began, and one after the other, the would-be kings began to try their luck one after the other. It quickly became apparent that the challenge was very difficult. The best archers on the first day needed 13 and 14 arrows. Even hitting an apricot with an arrow was difficult, as 90 and 100 yards often required multiple shots.

On the second day an elf from Oventhart appeared, named [[Aeluril]]. Several people were scared when they saw him, because he was dirty and worn out, and he had forest camouflage on. Ignoring the harsh judge against him, he took his bow and with the first shot he hit the first two apricots. With each subsequent shot, it dropped the next fruit. For the 100 yards he took his time, calculated the wind and the distance, and shot his arrow, which tore the apricot in two.

Somehow, this mysterious wood elf became the best candidate, and he retired to his corner, drinking some wine and waiting for the result to be announced. But the competition was not over. On the second day, several talents appeared, including several who wanted to compete with crossbow or javelin, but their wish was not granted. However, some archers were able to complete their efforts with eleven and ten arrows.

That same evening, a mysterious wayang named [[Silien]] was able to hit the third and fourth apricot with one arrow, tying Aeluril. However, his 100-yard shot had barely scratched the apricot, although because he had thrown it it technically counted. In the event of a tie for the best archer, another test had to be set. The king faced the very real possibility of acquiring a particularly undesirable son-in-law, according to his advisors. He was torn apart.

On the third day, an elf named [[Maltheon]], who was a scout from [[Green Hills]], was able to shoot the second and third apricot together with an arrow. All anxiously awaited the shot for the 100 yards, but his arrow lodged in the post an inch below the apricot tree, necessitating a tenth shot. At noon a dark-skinned noble, a nomadic archer from Markesh, named [[Delhan Poglu]] appeared. His first shot tore through the first three apricots together, and all subsequent ones one each. With eight arrows, Delhan could now be fairly certain that he had no opponent, while Aeluril and Silien found their efforts futile. At the same time, the king valued the southerners and their rich plains, and felt that Delhan would be a very good diplomatic choice. His advisers were quick to agree.

Several more archers continued to shoot, but Delhan sat eating and drinking mockingly, confident that no one could reach him. His victory was almost certain and he was already lustfully glancing at the king's daughter, [[Veronica]], who was sitting next to the king and looking desperately at the drunkard in the stained silks. She knew in her heart that any elf or wayang would be better than this loser.

The sun was starting to go down for good when a furry northerner appeared. He was introduced to everyone as Voldosh. Most had no idea what it was and accepted his name, but the elves smiled, for they knew it was not a name but a title of [[VÃ¸lrad]]. Without further ado, the northerner headed to the stadium and strung his big bow. Delhan sat up and began to observe him carefully, for he had realized that his bow was even tougher than his own. Discussions died down as several realized the same and focused on the large archer.

The northerner took his time to calculate his targets and drew an arrow to his bow. His first shot tore through the second and third apricots together. Delhan sat up, but knew that from now on it would be difficult for the northerner to do the same again. The northerner with his second arrow dropped the fourth fruit, and with three more arrows the fifth, sixth and eighth. Delhan now knew that he was almost impossible to beat. He stood up and walked closer to Veronica, his eyes shining. He turned to see the last, futile efforts of the northerner.

He wasn't done though. he drew two arrows from his quiver, stooped down, shot the first, and immediately aimed up and shot the second. The first tore the first apricot and was thrown into the air, while the second tore the seventh, the ninth and struck the tenth, just as the first arrow fell from above and the two arrows met in the apricot. Everyone was speechless, seeing his feat, and the northerner casually went to the king and asked for his daughter's hand. [[Meeldas]], true to his word, declared him victorious as the sun set. [[Veronica]] ran to hug him, relieved to have escaped Delhan's teeth.

The lord invited him to his mansion, but the northerner had other plans. He said his ship was waiting for him, and took Veronica to leave. The lord, angry, began to shout that this was not in the agreement. The northerner turned and looked him in the eyes.

"I am [[Jarl Yuradal|Yudaral Kasnajar]], of the [[Kalenvad]]. I have won your contest with honor, O king, and I take the hand of your daughter. Your palaces and your titles leave me indifferent. Farewell!"

And just like that, King Meeldas lost his daughter, and all the succession and alliance scenarios he had in mind were weakened. He ordered them to be stopped, but Yuradal with Veronica willingly at his side, had already made a run for it. They ran down to the harbor and jumped into his drakkar, which set sail for the north. And the king swore vengeance on the northerner who had humiliated him: Sure enough, Yuradal had broken no rule and eluded all the warships that pursued him, arriving safely at [[Hlafengrond]].
