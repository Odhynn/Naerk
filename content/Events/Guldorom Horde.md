Guldorom's great horde started amassing in Western [[Tarhelm]] that was abandoned centuries ago by the dwarves. Over the years, no one paid attention to this area, except for a few seafarers and lumberjacks, while the [[Deeps|Deep]] Passages were sealed. Since the year 4763 there have been reports of small war parties and scouts in many places, but no one seemed to heed these warnings seriously. Soon, later four advanced outposts were set up, three by dwarves from [[Mountain Anvil]] and one by humans in the north.

What no one could know were the enemy's preparations. Led by a powerful orc named [[Razmatak]], the orcs had multiplied and put aside inter-tribal conflict. By the next year, they had forged weapons and armor for their entire army and allied themselves with [[Krellantre]], queen of the Fomorians, a race of deformed and savage giants, as well as trolls long hungry from their holes.

When the horde began to advance, in the spring of 4765, the outposts fell within the first week. The warbands began to spread throughout Tarhelm and reached Awlass, where they began to lay siege to it. Of course, the answer was immediate. By then, the dwarves had supplied the entire [[Northern Darrok]] army with weapons, and a wall had been built around the city. The first reinforcements there came from [[Magrel Stoneface]], a warrior who could close holes in walls with her earth-manipulating abilities. The warriors in [[Awlass]] numbered over three thousand, and though the orcs and giants were outnumbered tenfold, they held without great losses.

That is, until the day the stone giants came too. There were at least a hundred of them, under the leadership of [[Bord]], a unique Stoneslinger, as they are called among themselves. When their stones began to be continuously thrown at the walls of the city, everything indicated that the city would fall within a few days. But the first help came from an elf named [[Jenga Lishibell]]. She came from [[Four Winds Monastery|the monastery of the Four Winds]] and created currents of air that reduced the speed and accuracy of their thrown boulders. At the same time, two dozen local [[Anhalt]] priests began healing the wounded and strengthen the defenses.

In that period, the dwarves held up well in the battles in the mountain and underground passages. Their leaders, [[Morgrim Hammerfist]] and [[Jummegrill Deepinghome]], respectively, organized defense lines, fortified crossings and were able to halt the enemy advance, causing them several casualties. A fourth force led by [[Razmatak]] himself advanced to the southeast. Resistance there was futile, and the orc horde began to advance and pillage almost undisturbed what they found within the mountains, reaching[[Serpent's Tail]].

But all of a sudden, in one of the many skirmishes, a small group of several clans were able to bear the fight to Razmatak's guard and decapitate him. Eventually, leaders to replace him were found in the hierarch of the horde, but by then it was already too late. The gates of the [[Mountain Anvil]] opened and from within poured out ten thousand armed dwarves led by [[King Rothgrom]] Hammersmash, along with four hundred stonefolk.

The dwarven main army met the orcs outside [[Awlass]]. The ensuing battle lasted an entire day. King Rothgrom split the army in two parts, one to defend the city and one to advance into the foothills. Each stage of this battle was essentially a test of who would fight from the best position. At first the dwarves lagged behind, but gradually they gained better and better positions hill by hill, and their losses dwindled.

In the afternoon his  brother appeared from the mountain, commanding a unit of five hundred mountain dwarves on war rams. By then, however, Jenga was dead, as the attack on the city was fierce and in an open field, with the first orcs to break through. But this had been learned in the monastery, as twenty powerful wizards and priests from the monastery had arrived with the dwarves. Their fury was unstoppable, and their attack literally crushed the orcs. Those who escaped north fell upon the main body of the dwarves, which could much more easily hold its ground than attack. By nightfall, Razmatak's horde was past.

However, this victory was not only determined by the battle at Awlass, but by many skirmishes in the south, which highlighted the heroism of many soldiers. Rumors and songs tell of warriors who held passages for days from hordes of enemies, and of traps that proved more deadly than even their creators had originally imagined. From then on, the [[Northern Darrok]]'s fighting strength was respected by all, and surely this played a part in why, twelve years later, [[Dumspergrond]]'s army [[War of the Titan|turned south]] and completely ignored the north.
