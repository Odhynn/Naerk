When [[Erstal]] declared independence from the Sultan's influence and began trade with [[Imtaria]] and [[Whistor]] without any control by the country's central administration, it was certain there would be consequences. The Sultan could not leave such an insult unanswered.

He gathered an army, and besieged the city from land and sea, making huge catapults and siege rams. After a month of unstoppable siege, his army broke the central gate and entered the city, slaughtering all the inhabitants who resisted and looting the houses. The Sultan was captured by all the members of the Council at the time and warned that every future disobedience would have consequences for their integrity.
