The firefolk [[Teeso]], shortly after the [[First Battle of Shadowflame|introductions]] and the [[First Battle of Shadowflame|battle]] confirmed the now [[Keldar]] hero's worst fears. He told him that [[Talkeri]], the fallen emperor of the ancient empire of [[Zulhan]], was responsible for all the undead. He kept his own identity hidden, but told him that the source of the evil came from the ancient palace to the north. And as long as the Talkeri's agreement with [[Voolthow]], the Shadow Lord, continues, the village and [[Marelthia]] as a whole would not be safe.

Apparently few believed him outside of Keldar, and even fewer outside of [[Kalyr]]. [[Sandling]] sent a team of healers to take care of the wounded, and promised future tax breaks, but that was it. Teeso told Keldar that he would do his best to inform him of the next attack, while the latter convinced the residents to build stone walls around the village. For two weeks the villagers built, and the walls soon reached six feet in height. Then, Teeso returned to the village with his lynx, CIV. And Keldar knew then that his time was running out.

_"How many days?"_ Ask the tracker.

_"I don't think more than four."_ Teeso replied quickly. _"I was able to buy some time by getting the vanguard out of the way."_

_"Alone?"_ [[Keldar]] exclaimed in surprise.

Teeso nodded wearily. _"Yes, listen... the main body of the army is in the thousands. Without an army from Sandling, we have no hope."_

_"Th-thousands? Ohhh... I'll let them know right away."_

Teeso grabbed his arm. _"If you don't have an answer by the day after tomorrow, get out of here. Go to Sandling. It's suicidal to stay here. Take supplies with you."_

_"Don't worry, I'm sure they'll send help."_

_"I wouldn't be so sure if I were you."_

_"They will send."_ Keldar replied flatly.

Preparations in the village were accelerated, but at the same time many families sent their children, elders and those who could not fight to the [[Sandling|city]]. The refugees alone let Lord [[Tergon]] know that things were much more serious this time. Within a day, he mobilized his knights and sent an elite body of five hundred heavy horsemen north.

When they arrived, the next morning, the undead army would reach the city in the late afternoon. General [[Luardan]] of the unit, after a detailed discussion, understood that the battle would drag on until the evening. But this had the consequence that the defenders would be at a disadvantage, as the undead could see normally in the dark. Also, horses would be useless in the narrow streets of the city. Luardan concluded that he should meet the renegade army in the open field, while he told the remaining inhabitants to huddle in the makeshift fortifications in case one overtook them.

The force of horsemen was spread wide, while [[Teeso]] himself took a horse from the village to lead them. Keldar took over the defense. The horses began at a light gallop, three furlongs deep, and began to gallop across the meadow, CIV, Teeso's lynx running alongside them. And indeed, they met the army of the undead before night fell. The first lines of skeletons broke before the onrush of the barricaded horsemen, but they were soon cut off as they drove deep into the enemy body.

Teeso swung his bright blade left and right, scattering bones everywhere, but his horse quickly collapsed from the successive blows of the skeletons. He stood up straight and swept horizontally, leaving no time for the undead to hit him. He was quickly surrounded, however, as the horsemen had overtaken him, and soon javelins and swords were striking at his armour. The CIV leapt to his side and scattered the skeletons behind him.

The tracker quickly confirmed that this army was well equipped, but even worse it wasn't just skeletons. To the horsemen's horror, dozens of hyenas sprung from among the undead, which began to attack the horses and spread panic. They seemed to thirst for the blood of horses, and their eyes were black, while their bodies were half-rotten. The lynx choked two that attacked Teeso, while he pierced a third through the abdomen with his sword.

The horsemen were now scattered, and he could no longer see what was happening as dust had risen. But he knew that someone commanded this army too: And he had to find him. He began to run forward, and with a shout the sword began to glow in the dusk, and slaughter any undead who came near him. Advancing, he found a wounded cloaked horse, with two hyenas biting his rump: He cut off the head of the first, while the horse got up and trampled the second. Teeso stroked the animal, and it winced slightly. _"Can you take me to your master?"_ He asked about it. It bowed the head.

Amidst the dust and shouts, the animal galloped forward, and soon several barricades saw his sword flash and followed him. Teeso arrived at a group of undead gathered to attack the downed Luardan, who had long since given up defending himself as only his elaborate armor protected him from the horde of enemies. With one charge they scattered the undead, to find [[Luardan]] struggling over the corpse of a huge giant, wrapped in gauze like a mummy.

After securing the perimeter, the horsemen regrouped and made another charge at the undead, who were beginning to scatter. And just in time: the last light began to fade on the plain of death, causing even the bravest horsemen to quickly give up the chase. Eighty-three horsemen and six militia were killed that day, but the second battle had been won. Now, no one doubted the magnitude of the threat: And once again, all eyes were on Teeso.
