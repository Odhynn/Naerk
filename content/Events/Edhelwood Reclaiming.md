The longevity of the elves made them never forget their defeat and the oppression of their people after the fall of the [[Edhellin]]. The hatred they harbored for the orcs multiplied in those years, and it was able to rally elves from the far reaches of Naerk. From the far reaches of the north to [[Imtaria]] and [[Oventhart]], the elves rallied under the banner of a proud but humble hero named [[Alazir]] Silverflame. Alazir was among the oldest surviving elves, and many believed him to be [[Talyrian]]'s grandson, though he himself remained silent on his parentage. He was stubborn and unyielding in his determination, and was able to unwittingly gather fifty thousand elves under his command, ready to attack.

The attack took place early in the spring of the year -1139. The orcs were caught off guard: Young, inexperienced warriors, facing elves who had been preparing their revenge and sharpening their swords for two centuries. The attack swept the orcs like a storm across the plain, and it is said that from this attack only four orcs survived, leaving them to carry the news to the four points of the horizon. The sudden re-domestication of Edhelwood this time outwards seemed like a catharsis at the end of a drama and no one wanted to interfere, while many were in awe of this display of power. Sure, the orcish cruelty towards the elves had been known to the outside world.
