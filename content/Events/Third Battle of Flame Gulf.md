The day after the [[Second Battle of Flame Gulf]], [[Hoarinhel]]'s fleet took the open sea in a bold move, heading straight for [[Dzultar]]. They destroyed the few ships that were left there with an easy battle, while the rest of the [[Dzultar]] navy in [[Nolgot]] island was not fast enough to return to the city in time and defend it.
