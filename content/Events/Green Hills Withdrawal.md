## A Journey that Turned South

During the [[Green Hills]]' diplomatic trip, a series of unexpected events were about to happen. [[Erdin]] Quakesville, brother of [[King Nurladan]], was traveling with three ships and escorted by an [[Imtaria]]n ship south to the island of [[Sinaxon]]. In the first light of the morning, behind the eastern cape of the island, a pirate ship appeared, which headed at high speed aimed at the ship where Erdin was.

The ship was rammed violently and hooks, ladders and ropes were thrown overboard. Sea devils and pirates jumped on board, and immediately a fierce battle began, in which the other ships were unable to approach due to a storm. Warriors from the [[Luminous Sword]] led by [[Thallior]] Loangot, Lord of the Cataphracts fought valiantly, but it was clear that they had been caught off guard. With no time to put on their armor, and with the pirates swarming all over the deck, several of them didn't even get to take part in the battle. The losses were mutual, but in the end the pirates got what they wanted: killing most of Erdin's personal bodyguard, they netted him prisoner and disappeared.

In the morning the warriors of [[Green Hills]] landed on a beach of the island, while they also captured the pirate ship, but there was not a soul in it. Of the pirates, for reasons unknown, had no wounded, only dead. Their ships surrounded the area and search parties were sent inland to find traces of the pirates. Imtaria sent reinforcements from wizards and trackers, who magically confirmed that Erdin was alive and on the island.

At noon, a scouting party was able to find an abandoned prison complex from [[Kultaria]]'s time, in which the pirates were hiding. Taking out the guards, they made it inside where they saw Erdin captured, along with 8 others of his guard. Somewhere there is also the point at which the narrative blurs, because there are different interpretations.

According to them, there was a traitor of the Green Hills who had organized the whole kidnapping: [[Harlyn]] Vonga, who was a trusted advisor to the king. In their attempt to intervene, he killed Erdin, but they were able to hunt him down and free 7 of the 8 captives. Harlyn had hired the pirates and Sea Devils, and by getting Erdin out of the way, he wanted to strengthen his own point of view in the king's council.

According to Harlyn, this group of scouts had agreed with the pirates on how the attack would be carried out and did not hesitate to attack him as soon as they saw him. They thought they could sell him back for a fabulous ransom, then make off with the money. However, none of them had given anyone the right to doubt their loyalty to the king, and when several began to ask what Harlyn's business was in the old prison, even the counselor's attempts at bribery and silence were not enough to to remove suspicion from him.

Lord [[Thallior]] took matters into his own hands, and threw Harlyn into prison, while placing the other three on hold until the situation was cleared up. As a consequence of this, the Green Hills' relations with Imtaria became very cold, and voices within the realm against the Palaurim multiplied. They accused Harlyn of being related to Imtaria and being double an agent, they accused the king that he shouldn't trusted him, and they believed that Erdin died because he was a staunch opponent of the alliance with Imtaria and the disastrous campaign in Paraselt. The three trackers were ultimately acquitted of all charges. However, a few days later, Harlyn disappeared from the prison, and all of his guards were murdered in the night.

Under pressure from lords and people, on 3 Graymist, the day of Erdin's funeral, [[King Nurladan]] announced that the Green Hills were leaving Palaurim permanently and irrevocably, to the surprise of all the foreign diplomats present, as described in [[Green Hills - Focus Shift]]. The decline of Palaurim suddenly seemed to have real consequences.
