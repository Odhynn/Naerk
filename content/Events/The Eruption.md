[[Amehan]] and his Titan hordes opened a huge rift in the earth and attacked the [[Material Plane]] from the place where [[Paraselt]] is today. With a huge volcanic eruption, the Vulga and the Erevi poured out of the mountains to the east and west and began to wreak havoc in their path. At the same time, lava, rocks and ash began to devastate vast areas of forest.

The realms in the material plane were caught off guard. The ancient kingdom of [[Aldaron]] was completely destroyed, and the capital city of Kilmahara was covered in ash and volcanic ash. The souls of the dead were stolen by the Titans and Vulga, and sent to Tartarus to create new warriors. Their advance continued, but the [[Gate]] from [[Tartara]] was closed when the lava solidified in the Volcano. Replenishing the Amehan army became impossible, and when the archangels [[Li-Tithlamir]] and [[Lo-Ukmasid]] appeared from the [[Fortress of the Just]] a fierce battle was fought in nowadays [[Rammok]], involving three human countries and the centaur kingdom to stop the advance of Amehan forces, which desolated the area with the spells used on it.

In the end, after many human and centaur sacrifices, as well as Li-Tithlamir's, the Vulga were defeated. Of the eight titans leading the army, only three were able to escape and survive, hiding in remote places on Naerk.
