[[Karahath]] was by far the most ambitious ruler of [[Kambah]], and his main desire was to expand his country under his absolute rule. He was not content with enlarging his territories: he also wanted to impose his will on the inhabitants of the surrounding regions, and establish Kambah as a military power in the entire [[Misty Sea]]. His ability to raise an army was evident from the first day he carved his majestic throne in [[Aar]]. The massive army he gathered to [[Defeated Army|attack the south]] was only his first attempt. Many believe that if, with the army at his disposal, he had attacked east instead of south then, [[Oventhart]] would have disappeared from the map. However, no one knows if he could completely impose this opinion on this bunch of orcs, giants, peasants and trolls and their egoistic leaders.

After the [[Battle of Fherlon Plains|defeat]] in the south, Karahath changed strategy. He demanded power from [[Sergonial]] with constant rites and sacrifices and the god gave it to him seemingly freely. The priests of Sergonial took the power of [[Hell]] into their hands and began to wield it uncontrollably. They found the best iron deposits and began to make weapons, strengthened the walls with magic, summoned [[Devils|devil]] beings from Gates and began to unite the whole country under the religion of Sergonial. The high priest himself, also known as [[Herlwix]], Karahath's right-hand man, was able to coordinate all these efforts, and he made an open call to the Kenorex of all countries to come there to help with the spy network and the growing and strengthening of the army.

Karahath made attempts to remobilize forces from Hoen mountain giants, but their response was trifling, following the earlier [[Battle of Fherlon Plains|defeat at Green Hills]]. Gorstrein Tronertefk himself, the king of Thunder Mountain, flatly refused him. However, even without them, his army quickly grew in size. In the end, the priests' biggest problem was how to improve agricultural production so that they could meet the ever-increasing food demands of the army, and they managed this with various spells that summoned demonic plants with an inexhaustible supply of seeds and fruits. Kambah soon became unrecognizable.

In the year 4772, Karahath was ready to make his move. His army numbered two hundred thousand warriors, one in four of whom was a Kenorex veteran, while his spy network was spread across his entire target: Oventhart. The icing on the cake was the devils, of many kinds, from flying archers to barbed beasts, generals and horned giants, and there were at least five thousand of them. Karahath was even able to convince a dragon, Kereilanzoga, to come and help, from Scalemist.

In the summer the offensive towards Oventhart began. Its inhabitants, for many reasons, were caught off guard. In part, Kambah had severed the already limited trade relations, so access and information from inside the country was small. The spy network made sure to assassinate anyone who knew too much, or bribe them to keep their mouths shut. Finally, the priests had covered many Gates and military installations with illusion magic so that they could not be easily detected. These reasons contributed to the effectiveness of the initial invasion.

Qumbar fell overnight, while Whitecross burned to the ground. Unariel was possessed by devils, and within a week refugees were running to the east for safety, while Kambah secured her new lands. The first serious defense against Karahath's advance was made on Nador, by a group of Makinsoth and other skilled warriors, mostly natives, who were later called the Layn'eth Knights and distinguished themselves in their ability to deal with all manner of diabolical beings. At Nador the advance stopped.

It soon became known that one of the reasons for the success is that Karahath himself was holding a Scroll of the Supreme Tyrrant, and he read it to Qumbar, disintegrating the city's defenses. The next period was spent with several skirmishes, as well as an attempt by the fiends and Kenorex to pass through occupied Unariel to northern Oventhart and besiege Melinor. This attempt however failed, for in the open steppes the archers and wizards of the elves and city guard had the advantage, and were able to stop the invasion.

Months passed and Oventhart's guerrilla war saw several small victories. However, Kambah expanded into Cavaroch Forest, and was able to take lands almost as far as Lorsal, Greenmills, and the Allwick Wilderness. However, in the fighting near Greenmills, two dragons appeared on Oventhart's side and were able to kill Kereilanzoga. In the south there were few devils with the army, so it was easier to deal with Kambah's forces by conventional means.

As it wintered, Oventhart's elven king, Kalonder Morningmist, was able to devise a counter-attack plan that would take Unariel by surprise and two days later Qumbar. Many people were gathered and recruited, but crucial to the success of the plan was the contribution of the people living in these two cities, who rose up against the yoke of Kambah and barricaded the Tyrran army. At the same time, Kalrond's cavalry joined the Greenmills' army and chased Karahath's forces into Oventhart Dale.

Since then, there has been a fragile truce. The spy network now works on both sides, so it's not easy for anyone to make the first move. However, Kambah still has Whitecross and the forest of Cavaroch under her control, and Qumbar has now practically turned into a fortress that also defines the borders of the warring countries.
