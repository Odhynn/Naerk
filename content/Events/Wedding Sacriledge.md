The Bolrag and Jargon families were in enmity for many years. The hunters of both families, belonging to the [[Lampsir|Swiftbow]] tribe, often stole foxes and hares from each other's traps. This, at first, seems to be the first occasion of this rivalry. The causes then multiplied as the Jargons began stealing sheep and mushrooms from Bolrag homestead, and they in turn then demanded a duel through the Missing Limb.

The Jargons refused, but this angered the Bolrag. In particular, the young [[Klabbe]] grabbed an ax and threw it at the old [[Vyrda]] Jargon's back, seriously injuring him. Then Falgyrd Bolrag, their ablest warrior, stepped in and demanded that a way be found to end this feud before more victims were mourned. So did [[Grilly]], Vyrda's daughter.

What few knew, however, was that the two are proposing exactly the same thing to the other families: With a wedding, their families would be united and hostilities would end once and for all. This proposal was accepted with many reservations by both families. In the North, it is difficult for a family to restrict the actions of two adult members, as long as they are not directed against the family, so each parent and grandparent must compromise with their child's wishes.

The marriage that followed, while at first appearing cold, proceeded quite pleasantly. Everyone seemed to be having a great time and the fun was on when an arrow shot through the trees hit [[Grilly]] in the neck. Within seconds, the bride fell dead, and whatever cheerful atmosphere there was was instantly dissipated.

Some Jargons drew swords and axes and attacked the Bolrags, shouting of betrayal, that they had been set up. Falgyrd, however, leaving the corpse of his beloved, threw himself into the middle, blocked the assailants with a stool, and swore that he would leave on the spot to find the murderer, and that if he returned without him they could behead him.

Oaths are sacred in the north, so hostilities stopped immediately. Falgyrd ran after the killer, into the forest, and it didn't take him long to find him, as he was a famous hunter. And after a while, he saw the killer, who had drawn a bow and was waiting for him behind a tree. Falgyrd rushed upon him unarmed, and put his hand forward, where he was stuck by the first arrow. The second was nailed to a tree he hid behind, and by the time he drew the third arrow Falgyrd had reached him. In his desperation the assassin dropped the bow and started running. [[Falgyrd]] took down the bow, plucked the arrow from his wrist and struck down the slayer with the arrow to the neck. Bleeding, he carried the body back and dumped it in the middle of the clearing where everyone was waiting. Then they saw the [[Skra|Steady Hand]] tattoo and everyone knew that someone had staged it all.

Since then, the feud between the two families has transformed into a feud between the two clans.
