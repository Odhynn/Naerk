Before the small tribes appeared in the North, this was home to the giants. Gadrunen's empire had extended from the Hoen, passed the Hoss, and reached as far as the Korhond and the Belgosreim. In Hlafentar was built the palace of the local lord, a Frost Giant who was second in command to the then Storm Lord, Jotusvir. The giants around the palace there built a huge fortress on top of a mountain, which dominated the coast: √çlafengrond. Unlike other forts, this one was carved out of the rock itself, not by placing one stone on top of another, giving it a unique resistance to weather and time.

Gadrunen's empire, however, gradually declined as Jotusvir grew old, and finally died in 1630. The giants in Hlafentar became independent, and were called Hither by the tribes that came later. Belgosreim soon fell from the giants' control, as the humans and orcs defeated them in many tactical battles, and the giants had lost their leadership and supply, and had great difficulty in replenishing their losses. Most left the tundra, and migrated back to Hlafengrond.

he first tribes of the north were now actively claiming living space: for livestock and to cultivate. But the obstacle to Fervolosh was Hlafengrond. Already the first orc tribes in the north were fighting in the Mherg taiga the few giants there and pushing them east: the Go'rokk and the Ragaron, who were fighting the Vagor nomads. To the south had gathered the tribes of Kalenvad, Skra, and Karnag, consisting mostly of humans and elves. Their leaders quickly realized that if they stayed there, the orcs would take over the entire forest and there would be no room left for their clans. So, they decided to take action.

All of their warriors gathered and formed one of the largest armies the North had ever seen. Over fifty thousand fighting men, with as many in reserve. They moved towards Hlafengrond. The giants in the fortress saw the forces from afar, and began throwing stones down the slope, causing huge landslides. Many warriors, however, climbed the wild mountainside, and were covered by the stones for much of the climb.

When they had now reached the fortress, the druids called upon huge badgers to carry the warriors three by three to the walls, followed behind by Skra archers with swarms of arrows. The giants were safe all this time and had managed to kill hundreds of warriors, but soon the battle became hand to hand. The first warriors who reached the walls were melted by chisels and hammers, which made them one with the walls: And other warriors followed, and each gap was filled by the next. Until the walls were painted red from mutilated and melted bodies.

The warriors fell prey to the giants' power more than in any past battle. Against them, all training seemed futile. But necessity compelled them to advance, and in spite of the losses they continued to scale the walls, and each warrior drove his spear into the giant guards, until they fell like hedgehogs, or retreated wounded and exhausted. The northerners continued the attack, until the giants began to disappear as they retreated: and as the city was taken, they found that there was not one left: all the retreating giants had disappeared.

Somehow, Hlafengrond fell into the hands of the tribes. The giants later built another city to the east, Hitherun, as the survivors ransacked it through an underground passage. The victors buried their dead in stone tombs and feasted, but this did not last long: The fortress could not be shared among the tribes: Only one would take it.

The Kalenvad had arrived at the palace first, while the Skra argued among themselves as to what their next move would be. Some Skra attacked the Kalenvad the following night, while others split off and fled to Fervolosh: those who later became known as the Lapsir. The Karnag wanted nothing to do with all this, and they too went east, and broke into many other groups, from the Kranor River to Folumb. Finally, the Skra realized after besieging the palace for a week that it was not worth the cost in blood they would pay and they had already lost many warriors. They looted what they could and left to claim their own living space in the forest, following the Lampsir.
