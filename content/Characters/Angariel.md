A practiced witch and alchemist that arrived in [[Tas-Roch]] during the [[Werewolf Siege]] and manipulated lord [[Slagis]] into trusting her to deal with the werewolves. She devised a potion that would help the werewolves control their form and [[Taurlin]], their leader, trusted her more than he should. She melted Veth crystals into her potion, causing different and unpredictable symptoms to appear in each patient. The potion proved to have severe effect on most of the werewolves, causing unwilling transformations on the next full moon, paranoia and even bloodlust. This saved most of the city folk, but she fled to the north as [[Taurlin]] hunted her as he had vowed to kill her if she betrayed his trust. At the same time, Slagis issued a public proclamation saying that the witch had betrayed his trust and that she had run away as a wanted woman.

Taurlin was able to find her near the [[Blackwoods]] two years later with a small team of hunters. After a long hunt in the woods, he was the only survivor of her traps when he found her scent. He chased her down, pounced on her and butchered her with bites and claws until she was a bloody pile of meat. He cut off her head and sent it to [[Tas-Roch]], where it was magically preserved to adorn the walls, by popular demand.

Mother of [[Tukai]].
