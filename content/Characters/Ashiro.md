## Great Northern War

Ashiro was born during the [[Great Northern War]]. Having experienced the consequences of war he hated it and tried to do everything in his power to stop it and every other war, believing that if he became powerful enough he would be able to put an end to it. Indeed, before he was even an adult he was strong, intelligent, skilled, as well as a very capable warrior, spellcaster and orator, managing overnight to prove to all those who wanted the war to continue that they should first deal with him and that this would be in vain. He thus managed to unite all those who were fighting together in one kingdom, [[Oventhart]], and became a factor of stability for it (it is imminent that, while for a millennium of his presence all was well in the kingdom, after his disappearance Oventhart began to show countless problems and barely collapses).

## Winter War

Being one of the most iconic figures in [[Naerk]], if not the most iconic, before he even reached the height of his power and abilities, the [[Winter War]] came. He joined the [[Stormcrushers]] and sieged the [[Eye of Veth]] from the winter witch [[Tayra]]. He almost killed her in a duel inside her Frozen Avatar, but she escaped. He assembled a force from [[Oventhart]], and fought in the final battle, killing the dragon [[Gridvalkur]]. He chased [[Tayra]] in the [[South Pole]] with [[Yøll]] and witnessed her defeat, as well as the final resting place of [[Evergrowing Forest]] as an [[Aspect]].

He played a critical role in the war like no other, in which he met for the first time a series of deities, from [[Yerastu]] to [[Sergonial]], as well as the [[Aspects]]. The conclusion he drew was that the gods see mortals as pawns with a role to slaughter each other for their own sake and whatever feuds they have at the time. The result was that he hated the gods, with the exception of perhaps the [[Aspects]], and he did manage to prove once again that he was right and that mortals can choose their own fate, when only he and three of his fellow warriors managed to turn the tide of the war and end it as they wanted in defiance of the will of the gods. Once again, the whole world was talking about Ashiro's abilities with the difference that this time it wasn't just mortals that were intrigued.

## Golden Age of Naerk

Ashiro therefore used the name he had made for himself, now able to terrify entire nations, to improve the world as a whole, thus ushering in the golden age of [[Naerk]].

## Omni-verse Tower Incident

This ended with the [[Omniverse Tower Incident]]. The [[Malgyra]] dispersed into the outer circle of the [[Elemental Ring]], beyond the control of the [[Elemental Lords]], leading them to war with each other, which was felt in the [[Material Plane]] immediately. Ashiro, though he hated it when gods used mortals to end their feuds, he could easily understand the consequences of their self-demise and he couldn't let that happen. He knew, however, that he was not enough to deal with them and force them to stop the war, as he did in all the other wars, as their power was stronger than any other, even the rest of the gods. However, he found the solution by deceived the [[Elemental Lords]], collecting all the Malgyra and became, if only for a moment, the Absolute in the [[Elemental Ring]]. The next moment the Malgyra were in their place, in the possession of their respective Lords and they once again found it pointless to fight each other. Ashiro was able to impose himself on the gods, or so he thought.

## Aftermath

All of existence was happy with the development and Ashiro thought that was enough to keep him alive, but his calculations had two errors. He thought that since most of the gods were happy with the end of the war, they would defend him against the wrath of the Lords and that one Lord would not mess with all the other Lords together. But he didn't consider that the existence of a mortal, who even for a moment, was capable of subduing the strongest gods, is an existence that almost no god would defend. He also failed to consider that the Lords, unable to tolerate a mortal meddling in their affairs in such a way, hated him so much that they were willing to put their differences aside to get him out of the way. They joined forces and created a colossal elemental of unimaginable power, which they sent into the material dimension to kill Ashiro.

## Wrath of the Gods

The power of the Ultimate Elemental, dubbed the [[Wrath of the Gods]] was such that, by its mere existence in the [[Μaterial Plane]], it brought unimaginable destruction to [[Naerk]]. Ashiro was willing to give his life to save the world, but that wouldn't change a thing, the elemental wouldn't magically disappear once Ashiro dropped dead, it would just wander aimlessly around the planet until it completely dissolved. Ashiro realized that there was only one solution. Five of his allies helped him with a ceremony to leave Naerk, in the farthest corner of the [[Void]], never to return. Once he arrived he closed his eyes, ready to pass away and rest in the [[Evergrowing Forest]], but the Elemental Lords were not meant to let him rest so easily. They sealed the area and made him immortal forced to eternally fight a battle he could never win.

In the end, Ashiro, the elf who dared to face the gods, ended up eternally hunted by their wrath.
