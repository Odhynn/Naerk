An old cleric from [[Edhelwood]], Erothel practiced the limits of life and death and pushed these limits with the power of his divine magic. A servant of [[Neverborn]], his practices were mostly frowned at, until the [[Second Siege of Dargonast]], where general [[Baelard]] decided to trust him in the defence of the [[Dargonast|city]]. His glyphs and powerful enchantments on a dozen warriors saved the city, but when he harvested the souls of the dead as agreed, he was tempted to use this unlimited power for his own gain. He resisted the urge and resurrected the warriors. Together, they formed the [[Baelarch]] and they undertake dangerous missions with the help of his death spells.
