A master craftsman, who carved the shape of [[Rod of Stone and Steel]]: an extraterrestrial from Kelzadam, who settled near volcanoes and the Deeps. Bodrig had a great reputation, for he had forged some of the finest weapons, such as the Shiji-sha katana. But Bodrig, in order to increase the scepter's power, added to the skeleton a bone from [[Ashatai]], an old friend of his who had become an angel from his deeds.
