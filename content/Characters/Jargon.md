Son of Elder [[Kaldran]] and friend of [[Trygg]], that led the [[Volnoch]] force on the [[Second Battle of Kiribung]]. He fall for [[Meegar]]'s bait and attacked the [[Skra]] camp, failed to overwhelm [[Helden]]'s defence and was soon surrounded by reinforcements leed by [[Meegar]], who had secretly circled the lake at night. Trygg and Jargon held each others backs while the first killed many warriors. Then, [[Helden]] Curnag attacked [[Jargon]] with his spear, but Trygg pushed him back. The blow though was enough to send Jargon's helmet flying. The rearguard continued to fall back, but then [[Meegar]] arrived, seeing Jargon momentarily unprotected: He climbed a tree, and leapt upon him, driving his ax into his skull. Trygg rushed at the assassin, but it was too late: Jargon was dead. This was a critical morale blow for [[Volnoch]]. They fled, while a few [[Raka]] archers shot arrows at the Skra to stop the pursuit.
