One of the very lucky few to have emerged from the Marleon arena, Krel is one of the most renowned warriors in [[Hashnev]]. He believes in fruitful dialogue that can yield mutual gains. When he gained his freedom, he turned to trade and trafficking in gladiators and animals and works closely with the Marleons. The pride of his fleet of ships, the Golden Rod, is one of the largest and most expensive ships in the port. When slavery became illegal in the city, he did not seem to be discouraged, but turned to other, equally productive avenues.
