A member of the [[Twilight Veil]] and potent Conjurer. He had [[Elerim]] as his apprentice in the cave. When [[Clapten]] was destroyed by the [[Vagor]] and [[Twilight Veil]] forces, he was the only wizard to enter the town. As he walked through the plundered [[Clapten]], he saw an orc who had killed an elf and was about to kill [[Ulsath|her child]]. Immediately, he grabbed the child and chased the orc away, cause, although he agreed with the destruction of the city, disagreed with the pillaging and brutalizing the inhabitants. Also, the girl reminded him of his own child, who had died of hypothermia after diving into Lake [[Rheosbung]]. So he hid the child with an invisibility spell and told her to run north, where she would be safe.

Flagwar led Ulsath to a shelter north of the lake, and told her to stay there. She was scared and cold, and had no idea what happened to her family. He made her a shelter with wood and sheep, and taught her basic rules of survival in the cold and wilderness. Until she reached the age of fifteen, he visited her every day and brought her food. Twilight Edge did not want to accept her into their ranks, as the wizards believed that the child was complicit in the city's miasma. So [[Flagwar]] continued to watch over her.

His traces were suddenly lost at 4750. He took on his personal quest to master the freezing cold of the north, and travelled to the unforgiving [[Coldmist]], where [[Ulsath]] found him frozen and dead after a failed ritual attempt. She swore to continue his legacy and master the elements of ice and snow.
