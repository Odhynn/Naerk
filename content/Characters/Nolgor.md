A huge fiendish orc warrior and bodyguard of [[Karahath]], with experience from numerous battles. He is a huge ironclad that instills fear even to his own warriors.

During the [[Tarthyn Invasion]], he led the charge to the [[Silkwin]] ramparts, jumped onto the walls and started running, trampling archers and knocking them off the walls. His armor was riddled with arrows but he seemed unstoppable. Between the defenders was a half-orc warrior from the [[Luminous Sword]] named [[Grok]]. Nolgor threw him away but he rose and began to strike at him with his iron fists, glowing with divine magic. Nolgor struck him in the chest with his hammer, but Grok answered with blows that rang through the fiendish soldier's armaments. A guard jumped at him from behind and tried to knock him down, but was injured by the violently swinging steel spikes of his helmet. Nolgor turned and melted his head with his boot. Then Grok found time and started throwing repeated punches at Nolgor, bringing him to his knees. With a sudden movement, however, he struck his jaw with the hammer and flung the devotee away. Nolgor rushed to finish him off but suddenly a huge wall of fire appeared in front of him. He ran into it and emerged unscathed, only to see a collapsed part of the wall in front of him. He roared and continued to walk in the void as he understood the illusion. A gnome mage had taken up position behind Grok and was delaying him with deceptive spells. Grok was down though, so he made him invisible with one spell and with a second they jumped to the opposite tower.

Soon, the spot Nolgor had cleared was filled with [[Kenorex]] warriors. After they established a foothold, they tried to advance to the first building block, but were greeted by a shower of arrows and divine fire and were forced to stop. But the outer wall had fallen, and the warriors began to gather there, taking cover from the surrounding towers. As night began to fall, hostilities ceased, but the Kenorex would not let the inhabitants rest and mourn their dead. Unearthly screams from hideous creatures broke the silence of the night, along with occasional catapult shots.
