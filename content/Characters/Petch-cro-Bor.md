A giant mutated orc that led one of the biggest orc tribes of Kambah. He pleged his loyalty to [[Karahath]] and followed him to a [[Defeated Army|campaign]] against [[Imtaria]] to the south. He fought at the [[Battle of Fherlon Plains]] destroying three Imtarian battalions but was eventually surrounded and overwhelmed by enemy cavalry forces. He died by the blade of the squirre [[Thallior]] fighting [[King Morran IV]] but he left the king with a serious wound with his serrated blade. The king died after two weeks of excruciating pain.
