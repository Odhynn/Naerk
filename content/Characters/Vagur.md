The first and greatest linnorm that fought [[Fraugmeneir]] and is responsible for the [[Linnorm Curse]] that haunts their kin. After the fierce battle with the dragon and the betrayal of [[Malahir]]'s trust, he lives hidden in the northern wastes and evades detection. Only three have seen him since and lived to tell the tale: [[Velchor]] the Bold, [[Jarl Sn√•fr]] Kugroen of the Bear Tribe, and [[Falgyrd]] Bolrag, one of the most renowned Linnorm Hunters.
