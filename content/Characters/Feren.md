## History

At the beginning of the fifth millennium, there was a large void of space - in the wooded southeastern foothills of the [[Hoen]] Mountains - that three dragons, one white, one silver, and one forest, soon came to claim. The battle that ensued was fierce. The biggest and strongest was the last one: Feren. Although the two weaker dragons had the intelligence and cunning to cooperate against the strong, the silver's code of honor did not allow him to cooperate with the white and that honor was why he lost his life. The white one put up a very hard fight and finally fled. Feren, tired from the battle, slept and settled in the heart of his new kingdom, near the source of river [[Urlejok]].

He fathered two wyrmlings, [[Feneg]] and [[Faeg]], and after the mid-millennium, Feneg, his eldest son ruled the region but let his sister live with him.

In the spring of the year 4818, not even half a month after the birth of his grandson [[Efren]], son of [[Faeg]] and [[Feneg]], [[Angasar]], [[Oliven]], and [[Al]] the Seer found themselves performing a ceremony on the southern border of their territory, awakening him â€” who until then everyone thought that he has traveled to another, unknown region - from his long sleep. A fierce and chaotic battle broke out. [[Oliven]] took on the mighty Feren who was stronger and angrier than ever, Angasar fought his firstborn son [[Feneg]] and [[Al]] along with an alchemist, an orc blacksmith, a priest and three guards kept [[Faeg]] at a safe distance to not interfere with the ceremony. Angasar managed to kill Feneg using the help of trees and forest animals. Oliven unleashed a series of powerful lightning bolts that struck and seared the beast and with another lightning bolt at Faeg he knocked the two dragons to the floor, never to rise again.

Thus came to an end the rule of mighty Feren.
