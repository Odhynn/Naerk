Daughter of [[Zeith Gyr]] and an elf. To most, she was just a princess, helping her father with his chores. What most people didn't know, however, is that at night she was **Nyrda**: An executioner who went out and killed criminals. A ruthless killer who left a black and white note with a snake on it for her victims. Suspected member of the [[Khalarsnake]].
