Attor, according to the story of the giants, was the first of his kind. Of unknown origin, the spawn of some [[Primordial]], he was hunted by the huge dragons of his time and hid in caves. With a chisel and a hammer he carved the first runes into the stone, but they had no power. They were simple letters on the stone, meaningful only to him. He knew the earth had power, but he didn't know how to use it. So he continued to carve out his wishes, until he reached the highest mountains and deepest chasms, and with his strokes he finally got [[Tarov]] to pay attention to him. He had hit a nerve.

_"Why are you digging on me? It itches!"_ He heard a voice in his head. _"What are you trying to accomplish?"_

"My life is hard." He answered. "I write about my hardships, sadness and pain. Someday someone will listen and understand me."

The voice fell silent. Attor continued to carve, when another, deeper voice was heard again after what seemed like an eternity. _"Do you want your work to gain meaning and power?"_

"Attor didn't think much of it. _"Yes."_

_"You don't want to hear my terms?"_

_"No. Any terms are better than the life I lead now."_

And just like that, the Elemental Lordess [[Gibba]] breathed the first rune upon [[Naerk]], through the [[Leylines]] of [[Tarov]]. And Attor travelled around the world and continued to carve runes, from which his children gradually began to emerge, imbued with the elemental power of his runes: the Mountain Giants and the Stone Giants. Runes came to be used for protection against dragons and other threats, for construction, for healing, and for various other uses, and became the center of their communities.

The other [[Elemental Lords]] however were not happy with the power Gibba had taken. The hidden stipulation, which Attor never wanted to hear, was that all his descendants would be captives of the [[Earth Quarter|elemental dimension of Earth]], and their souls would return there to aid her in her battle against fire, air, and water. This created a lot of tension in the [[Elemental Ring]] when the other three found out.

Constantly plotting, they didn't just stay there. Attor realized, growing old, that he had condemned his race to suffer even after death, forced to serve the realms of stone. What at first seemed like a condition for them to live with dignity turned into a prison. He secretly carved other runes as well, and asked Tarov to keep them secret, in an attempt to give more freedom to his siblings. He traveled and carved them on mountaintops, where the wind raged, inside volcanoes or in the depths of oceans. And with these runes he asked of [[Saekla]], [[Hydarax]] and [[Fyrlean]] the same thing he asked of Gibba.

Thus appeared giants of Fire, Ice, Storm, Clouds and various others. At first they stayed in these remote locations, but gradually they expanded. And when the extent of the power Attor had given the Lords became apparent, chaos reigned in the [[Elemental Ring]], with constant fighting. But two things were certain: All the giants would return there after death, and no lord after all seemed to have the upper hand. This was also Attor's hidden plan. After he had condemned his tribe, if at least one of the four had not come out victorious.

After some time, a balance was restored to the Elemental Ring. But they were still all angry with Attor, and when he died, they reserved for him the worst punishment of all. They divided his soul into four pieces and each took it to his kingdom. Since then, no one knows what has become of these pieces: Many prophets of the giants, however, hear in their minds the sufferings and screams of Attor, but they feel at the same time the grief of the First Giant, who unwittingly condemned all his descendants to an eternity in the Elemental Ring, to do the Lords' whims.
