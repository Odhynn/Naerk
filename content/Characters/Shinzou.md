The fierce lord of the Are Clan of Thunder in [[Sennarin]]. He waged war against the Oni and the [[Bj√•glant]] invaders and established his seat in [[Shiliage]]. He was very bold and executed deserters from the field of battle. His people faced starvation and several other harsh difficulties upon arrival. After the fierce third invasion and ensuing battle and hard won victory, he accused Lord Hida [[Ishigaki]] for incompetence and treason, forcing him to leave in exile. It is rumored that he sent assasins to killed the exiled clan leaders, after he learned the formation of the [[Wolf Legion]].
