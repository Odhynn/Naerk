A traveling giant from [[Hoen]]. He is friendly and peaceful. 

He introduced himself to the [[Fosh]] tribe as a historian. He carried countless runes and books with him and was very curious to learn and record the customs and habits of the locals. As the winter in the north in that year of 4796 proved especially harsh, the giant sat there, and soon became a friend and advisor to [[Jarl Rakof]], who valued his wisdom highly. Rakof went so far as to trust him with his newborn daughter, Lengosha. The giant loved the baby, who went so far as to cry whenever she was not in his arms, preferring him even to her mother.

 When spring came, Dalvuigg said goodbye to Fosh and the Jarl and made his way back to Hoen. What few knew, however, was that Rakof was an advisor to Skalindrosh. Returning to Tronerdim, Rakof recounted in detail his experiences at the Giant King's court. But many prying ears heard these details. One of them was that of Gert, an ice giant who realized that he could rob Korhond of these riches. He hid his movements from Skalindrosh and moved west.

 The Fosh clan were surprised to find one morning that an army of hundreds of giants had camped outside Osfan and were preparing to attack them. Archer divisions were sent to deal with them. Their first shots laid down five giants, but they responded by hurling huge chunks of glacier that melted anyone in their elliptical path and quickly scattered the defensive line. The giants charged into the village in order, and then Rakof in his desperation found a rune Dalvuigg had left for him to communicate with and activated it, clutching it to his chest.

 Grigora became aware of the incident and teleported to Rakof's house. When he realized what was happening, he appeared before the giants and demanded that they stop. Gert, despite his violent instincts, could not disobey Skalindrosh's counsel, and was forced to stop his warriors. However, he also had the right to call for a duel, to pass his own. He took a risk, but he felt an obligation to the townspeople. Gert knew that sacking the city was worth the small risk that Skalindrosh would be displeased with him: And that was because Dalvuigg, though a meter taller, was not a warrior in his eyes, but a scholar, and he believed that he would take him out . easily out of the way.

 Dalvuigg realized that with all of Gert's army supporting him, he could not refuse the duel. But he could hope that his soldiers could replace his office if he won, and stop further bloodshed. The people of Osfan sent the civilian population away from the city and created a defensive cordon around it, worried about the outcome, while the giants gathered to watch the duel.

 In giant duels, everything is allowed: from magic, to tradition, which must be accepted. The rules were established in ancient times and all giants must respect them. So Dalvuigg drew a knife and began to invoke his magic, while Gert, armed, charged at him with his spear. A circle of runes had formed on the ground around the word, forming an igloo. Gert with a few blows broke the ice, but inside Dalvuigg had managed to transform into a huge mammoth with carved tusks.

 He attacked the beast with his spear, which had an icy tip. Dalvuigg parried a few blows with his tusks, but more and more were coming at him. Unlike Gert, he was immune to the psyche, and his movements gradually became slower and stiffer. With his proboscis he jabbed at the warrior from time to time, but he was wearing armor and could not do him much damage. Whenever he tried to grab him with his tusks, he impaled him with his spear and forced him to let go.
