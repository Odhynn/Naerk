An ancient and wise dragon, Hrondoshel is thought to be amongst the oldest known brass dragons and dragons generally. He took part in the [[Unnamed Judgement]] and condemned [[Rhekvethor]], [[Salkor]] and [[Tavethir]]. He bestowed his power to [[Droghor]] using his descendant, [[Haldisoir]], as a conduit. In later battles, Droghor transformed to his form and it was during the [[Siege of Four Winds]] in this form that he killed the Storm King [[Skalindrosh]].
