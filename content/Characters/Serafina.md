Born and raised in [[Nargythe]], the daughter of the dark [[Edhelhecil]] elf that plegded their race to [[Sergonial]]. She was a descendant of [[Fyrlean]] and channeled powerful fire magic. She took active part in the [[Winter's War]] and played a critical role in stopping the frozen hordes of the [[Icebringers]]. Eventually, she confronted her treacherous mother. She tried to trap her, so she had no choice but to escape to [[Fire Quarter]]. There she found a powerful efreeti, who turned out to be her ancestor. He decided to help her in the battle she was fighting by giving her precious magical items.
