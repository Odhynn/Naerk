Born and raised in [[Nargythe]], the daughter of the dark [[Edhelhecil]] elf that plegded their race to [[Sergonial]]. She was a descendant of [[Fyrlean]] and channeled powerful fire magic. She took active part in the [[Winter's War]] and played a critical role in stopping the frozen hordes of the [[Icebringers]]. Eventually, she confronted her treacherous mother. She tried to trap her, so she had no choice but to escape to [[Fire Quarter]]. There she found a powerful efreeti, who turned out to be her ancestor. He decided to help her in the battle she was fighting by giving her precious magical items.

In the final battle, holding the [[Eye of Veth]], [[Serafina]] desperately demanded the [[Wajabat]] wand from Ashiro. He gave it to her and flew off to help his warriors, who were fighting two ice worms. He then found himself at YÃ¸ll's side trying to get over the ramparts. The witch gathered her strength walking towards the Avatar, and with Wajabat's help she summoned a fiery blaze, throwing the eye at the Avatar's feet. [[Ansiv]] had warned her to be careful about the item's power.

The ensuing explosion dissolved the blizzard and from the searing heat all creatures of cold within a mile radius were sublimated. Many warriors near the witch were also burned, while further away everyone who was unprotected was covered in burns. The flash momentarily blinded many, and when their sight was restored, they saw that the Icebringers' army had been mostly annihilated, while the Avatar, Ansiv, and the Stormbringers outside of [[Angaeradh]] had disappeared. With renewed strength, the Grand Alliance army rushed at the remaining undead, with [[Prince Valanir]], [[Angeradh]], and the [[Raven King]] at the forefront. The [[Icebringers]], scorched and decimated, retreated, and the rearguard of the upper fortifications with forces of fiends and Oventhart's warriors descended to reinforce the pursuit.
