The wise but greedy queen of the cloud giants in [[Tarhelm]]. She denied entrance to [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]] at the [[Four Winds Monastery]], trying to bargain them for some artifacts. Her warriors mortally wounded [[Domovoi]] as they fled to the temple and he returned to attack them at a deathless frenzy. He killed her bodyguards and reached her, killing her in his dying breath. This action is believed to be the beginning the [[War of the Titan]].
