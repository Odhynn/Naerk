A huge sea dragon that took part in [[The Blaburry Expansion]], causing numerous kitsune and fey casualties. She guarded a [[Bloodscale]] temple from the fey attack of [[Tikimura]] and [[Queen Valauri]] and had reinforced the temple's defenses with lizardmen. Tikimura with a spell broke the stone entrance and the fey rushed inside. The witch made their weapons glow as they began to slaughter the lizardmen, and soon they were near the shrine. There, Alfavriix was waiting for them, who started throwing acid at them and slaughtering anyone who came near with her thorny claws. Valauri jumped on her back and began to stab her with her sword, but she threw her down and raised her leg to melt her. Tikimura chanted an incantation and the dragon's leg was impaled on a stalactite sticking out of the ground. She screamed in pain and tried to run away, but Tikimura threw flaming bats at her which blew her head off. Valauri took advantage of the situation and impaled her neck with her sword.
