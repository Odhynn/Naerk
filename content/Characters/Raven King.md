A mysterious fey figure with an unknown portfolio. He is rumored to have fought in [[Winter's War]] and to always be the reason for enmities and war. He wields [[Zaitan]], the Nightcaller, and wears the [[Armor of the Nameless Warrior]], a main reason not much is known about him. He is rumored to be an ill-omen and a troublemaker, as many are prejudiced against him.
