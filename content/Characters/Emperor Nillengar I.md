## Fall of the Neruso Dynasty

A nobleman that took control of the rioting mob against the dummy [[Emperor Kaldos IV]] Neruso. A great merchant, shipmaster and the castellan of [[Syvorms]], he openly questioned the emperor's authority and condemned his decisions. People from all walks of life began to rally to Nillengar's side, and soon a massive campaign towards the capital began, which met little resistance from the officials. Two-thirds of the guards openly supported Nillengar, and only a tenth of the soldiers sent from [[Vaedar]] tried to stop him.

The decisive battle was fought on the plains east of [[Lanxia]], ​​and was called by both sides [[Battle of Traitors Field]]. The emperor's supporters numbered only eight thousand, against fifty thousand regulars and irregulars who were on Nillengar's side. The lord broke their lines with a cavalry charge, but respected those who surrendered afterwards. His march continued to [[Vaedar]], where he found the gates open and the people hailing him as a hero.

The palace was closed, however, as the Imperial Guard had sworn to protect the emperor with their lives. No one wanted to break their oath, so everyone locked themselves inside and prepared for a siege. The palace was impregnable and the first attempts to scale the massive walls failed miserably. Nillengar's attempts to enter continued over the next few days, but to no avail. The few climbers who reached the ramparts met a tragic end at the hands of the guards, and no ladder was high enough to reach the top.

In the second week, a new recruit of the Imperial Guard impaled the Emperor with his spear. His name has been erased from all books, and the guard next to him killed the traitor without a second thought. The emperor's murderer, and traitor to his oath, is the greatest oathbreaker in the entire history of the Imperial Guard, and many say that he was manipulated by magic to do so. In any case, with Kaldos dead, the siege was lifted, the palace opened, and Nillengar proclaimed himself Emperor, with the people and nobles cheering him on. Thus ended the Neruso dynasty and began the Ragas dynasty.

## Aftermath

After the end of the Neruso dynasty, the aristocrats of the empire had to decide the Emperor worthy of their support. Nillengar seemed the easy choice, as he enjoyed the undivided support of the people and could ensure the stability of the territory. However, there were many who did not agree with him. To the south, from the city of [[Oscia]], several lords had emerged who supported the previous dynasty and did not like that someone from the inland sea would decide for their own interests.

Nillengar initially ignored their reactions. He wanted to ensure that the state could stand on its feet, and his younger brother, [[Emperor Karys I|Karys]], who was an expert in accounting matters, helped him a lot in this. The first laws to be implemented attempted to support production and distribution networks, and the second ones supported trade. Taxation was slightly reduced, and the brothers enjoyed particular popularity.

However, the lords from [[Oscia]] had other plans. They contacted the [[Crimson Steel]], who sent agents from [[Whistor]] to get the brothers out of the way. The assassins attacked both brothers simultaneously. Nillengar was on a tour of the city at the time, and the assassins managed to disguise themselves as merchants and slip into the crowd. In an instant, they approached him and threw a knife that pierced his throat. It was enhanced with magic, as in an instant the emperor turned to ash before the stunned townsfolk.

His surviving brother [[Emperor Karys I|Karys]], furious, avenged his death by killing and hunting the assassins and lords responsible.
