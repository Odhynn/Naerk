A [[Demonslaver]] wizardess that loathed [[Anthis]] and his stupid ambition. When he summoned the [[demons]] that attacked and destroyed [[Pyrlon]] through his uncontrolled portal, she was one of the few wizards that was prepared and survived the initial attack. She had casted all the defensive spells she knew and demons couldn't harm her easily. Unable to teleport away, she shot bolts of lightning from her hands and roasted the first demon that reached her alive, but the rest blocked her every possible  way of escape. They began pounding her with claws and swords, but to no avail. After a while she got tired and when [[Knaritzna]] fell on her, he knocked her down and immobilized her. The demons then hung her on the walls and began to torture her.
