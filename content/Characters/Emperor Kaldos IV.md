Kaldos the Fourth, [[Empress oscia II]]'s only son and the last emperor of the Neruso dynasty was crowned and found Imtaria at its lowest point. The army was bad equipped and full of old soldiers, the coffers were empty, the borders were left undefended and in many barren regions famine prevailed. His mother passed him an almost ruined empire.

His reign was short and predetermined. [[Imtaria]] went from bad to worse every day, and his personality did not help. A spoiled child, raised in the palace, he had never left the limits of the capital and lived in the luxury and well-being offered to him by his mother. He believed that all problems would be solved with one order, but this was a method that his mother had abused and now was short-lived. The lords around him began to give him advice on necessary restructuring, but he was afraid to make decisive moves and was content to maintain some infrastructure, indifferent to the problems that multiplied.

Riots broke out in entire prefectures that refused to cooperate with a dummy, as they called him. Kaldos ordered the dissidents to be violently stopped, and began burning and destroying their proclamations. He forged the official documents of the economic staff, trying to present a picture of improvement, which only exacerbated the problem, as the improvement goals set for industry, ports and farms were not feasible. The people became hostile to the officials and soon even the guards were deserting without hesitation.

Among the rioting mob, there was a nobleman, [[Emperor Nillengar I|Lord Nillengar Ragas]], who openly questioned the emperor's authority and condemned his decisions. He was a great merchant and shipmaster, and the castellan of [[Syvorms]]. People from all walks of life began to rally to Nillengar's side, and soon a massive campaign towards the capital began, which met little resistance from the officials. Two-thirds of the guards openly supported Nillengar, and only a tenth of the soldiers sent from [[Vaedar]] tried to stop him.

The decisive battle was fought on the plains east of [[Lanxia]], ​​and was called by both sides [[Battle of Traitors Field]]. The emperor's supporters numbered only eight thousand, against fifty thousand regulars and irregulars who were on Nillengar's side. The lord broke their lines with a cavalry charge, but respected those who surrendered afterwards. His march continued to [[Vaedar]], where he found the gates open and the people hailing him as a hero.

The palace was closed, however, as the Imperial Guard had sworn to protect the emperor with their lives. No one wanted to break their oath, so everyone locked themselves inside and prepared for a siege. The palace was impregnable and the first attempts to scale the massive walls failed miserably. Nillengar's attempts to enter continued over the next few days, but to no avail. The few climbers who reached the ramparts met a tragic end at the hands of the guards, and no ladder was high enough to reach the top.

In the second week, a new recruit of the Imperial Guard impaled the Emperor with his spear. His name has been erased from all books, and the guard next to him killed the traitor without a second thought. The emperor's murderer, and traitor to his oath, is the greatest oathbreaker in the entire history of the Imperial Guard, and many say that he was manipulated by magic to do so. In any case, with Kaldos dead, the siege was lifted, the palace opened, and Nillengar proclaimed himself Emperor, with the people and nobles cheering him on. Thus ended the Neruso dynasty and began the Ragas dynasty.
