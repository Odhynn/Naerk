A conspirator [[archdemon]] that lost in the [[Demonic Civil War]] and was forced to inhabit a desolate, remote corner of the [[Abyss]]. An ancient, hulking warrior, in rusted armor, with a mace hilt scratched by thousands of dead enemies. Forgotten at the edge of the Abyss, and scorned by his own people, he asked the [[Stormbringers]] for a chance for one last glorious battle, and that chance was given to him. Thus, he rose from his stone throne and came to the [[Material Plane]] during the [[Winter's War]] and fought in the final battle, killing thousands of [[Icebringers]] and breaking the leg of the Avatar of [[Fallfaunt]] before it impaled him in the chest with a frozen stalagmite and he fell dead, his wish for a glorious fight fulfilled.
