## Story

A loyal dragon of [[Dragonpact]], she clashed with [[Haldisoir]] during a [[Disputed Feast]].  She lost her eggs by thieves (including [[Droghor]]'s father and uncle) hired by [[Bloodscale]] cultists. The eggs were used for a ritual to empower some Wyrmspawn. She guarded a [[Solarium Rings|Solarium Ring]] in her lair at a mountain in [[South Watchers]] after [[Fildagar]]'s death, and eventually gave it to the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]].
