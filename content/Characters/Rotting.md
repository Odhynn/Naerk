Rotting was a starving nomad child found by [[Voldrak]]. He took it under his protection, taught him how to fight and quickly he became his bodyguard. Rotting fought at the [[Battle of Fellgaunt]] and killed numerous soldiers with his arrows from the walls. Afterwards, he followed [[Voldrak]] at raiding caravans and at skirmishes until his sudden death. The archer is believed to be one of the main nomad leaders currently and was converted to [[Karadosh]] faith.
