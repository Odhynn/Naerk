Rotting was a starving nomad child found by [[Voldrak]]. He took it under his protection, taught him how to fight and quickly he became his bodyguard. Rotting fought at the [[Battle of Fellgaunt]] and killed numerous soldiers with his arrows from the walls. Afterwards, he followed [[Voldrak]] at raiding caravans and at skirmishes until his sudden death. The archer is believed to be one of the main nomad and [[Gheren Steed]] leaders and was converted to [[Karadosh]] faith. Suspicions rose eventually that he loathed [[Voldrak]] and he was the one he assassinated him. [[Delhan Poglu]], however, the new [[Gheren Steed]] leader stopped these rumors and restored his position as second-in-command.
