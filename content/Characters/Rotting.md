Rotting was a starving nomad child found by [[Voldrak]]. He took it under his protection, taught him how to fight and quickly he became his bodyguard. Rotting fought at the [[Battle of Fellgaunt]] and killed numerous soldiers with his arrows from the walls. After the battle, he grew fond of war and started wandering outside of civilization. While roaming on the plains was captured by [[Kandir]] and [[Tavethir]] for suspicions of looting but was deemed innocent and was freed. Afterwards, he followed [[Voldrak]] at raiding caravans and at skirmishes until his sudden death. The archer is believed to be one of the main nomad and [[Gheren Steed]] leaders and was converted to [[Karadosh]] faith. Suspicions rose eventually that he loathed [[Voldrak]] and he was the one he assassinated him. [[Delhan Poglu]], however, the new [[Gheren Steed]] leader stopped these rumors and restored his position as second-in-command.
