The first and most powerful king of the Edhellin, the First Elves. Erlamin was given [[Vaelasil]], the orb of darkness by [[Voolthow]]. Erlamin was one of the first Edhellin and his wisdom was acknowledged by all the ancient elves. And his magical ability scared [[Voolthow]] himself, as he believed that in a millenia, he could even pose a danger to the power of the gods. So he took the initiative to give him the magic orb, which in addition to unlimited power, imbued its owner with arrogance and corruption, concepts that the ancient elven language didn't even have words for to be able to interpret.

In the next decades he started to force very strong wizards to work on creating powerful magical weapons. At the same time he enforced policies that discredited the strongest among the Edhellin as the elite of the realm, and in less than a century the social stratifications within the ranks of the elves were now noticeable. Five different factions were formed, each with its own agenda and trying to gain more and more of Erlamin's trust.
