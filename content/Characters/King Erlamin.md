The first and most powerful king of the Edhellin, the First Elves. Erlamin was given [[Vaelasil]], the orb of darkness by [[Voolthow]]. Erlamin was one of the first Edhellin and his wisdom was acknowledged by all the ancient elves. And his magical ability scared [[Voolthow]] himself, as he believed that in a millenia, he could even pose a danger to the power of the gods. So he took the initiative to give him the magic orb, which in addition to unlimited power, imbued its owner with arrogance and corruption, concepts that the ancient elven language didn't even have words for to be able to interpret.

In the next decades he started to force very strong wizards to work on creating powerful magical weapons. At the same time he enforced policies that discredited the strongest among the Edhellin as the elite of the realm, and in less than a century the social stratifications within the ranks of the elves were now noticeable. Five different factions were formed, each with its own agenda and trying to gain more and more of Erlamin's trust.

When Sylris called the faction leaders and the king to a council, the king was already biassed against the wizard. He addressed them inquiring why all this strife was happening and what it was for. He then saw the king rise menacingly and accuse him of betraying the [[Edhellin]] nation, as he believed that the only reason the council was called is because of Sylris' personal ambitions.

Sylris coldly replied, _"You are out of your mind! This orb you hold in your hands will ultimately bring about the destruction of our race!"_

Erlamin's mocking reply was, _"Really, you think you're going to influence my government with baseless accusations? Is this all happening because you want it to? The orb to come into your possession?"_

Erlamin recognizing how dangerous a rival Sylris could make for his power, revoked him as a traitor to the Edhellin, an ally of humans and dragons (as he maintained excellent relations with dragons as well as human kings). Thus Sylris became the first exile of the [[Edhellin]].

At the [[Day of Wild Magic]], after a fierce magic battle against [[Sylris]] and [[Nentha]], he was imprisoned eternally to [[Eruvim]]. In order to preserve a civilization, in addition to traitors, heroes are also needed. This hero had to be the greatest enemy of the traitor, with the result that Erlamin went down in history with the name Forn Delvis, which meant "the gift of light".
