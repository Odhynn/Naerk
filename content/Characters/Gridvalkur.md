An ancient glacial dragon that was awoken by [[Tayra]] during the [[Winter's War]] in South Pole. When he awoke from his eternal slumber. The legends of [[Thimvert]] say that he was as old as Naerk herself, a powerful and massive reptile that had to be imprisoned in the coldest place in the world to make sure it would not terrorize the world again.

[[Eye of Veth|Veth's eye]] awoke the dragon, who was forced to respect [[Fallfaunt]]'s power in [[Tayra]]'s person. He agreed to help her with her plans, that included reaching much further north, and performing the ceremony where she would summon the Goddess Avatar. When [[Gridvalkur]] realized the state the world had fallen into, he decided to destroy everything connected to the [[Dragonpact]], disgusted with the decline of his race. He rose from his slumber and began to destroy the few fishermen and hunters he found in his path. The earth itself froze as the two of them began to travel north.
