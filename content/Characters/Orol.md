A stone giant shaman and a well respected leader of his tribe. He was killed by [[Bord]], likely sent by [[Dumspergrond]], to coerce all the stone giant tribes to join the titan in his [[War of the Titan|war]]. He was set as an example of what would happen to those that refused to fight and after his death most of the tribes joined Dumsper.
