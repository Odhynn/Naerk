[[Whistor]]'s commander-in-chief, named Kuthnor, assumed the kingship temporarily after a coup that threw counselor [[Della]] and [[King Raldon]] into prison for betrayal of the people. A month later, a pirate ship appeared in port, demanding to see if Della was in good health, as well as demand the agreed upon tribute. Kuthnor not only refused to pay, saying that he had no knowledge of any tribute, but further threatened that if the pirates made any attack, he would not care for the lives of the king's sons at all, and would attack the pirates with all his might.
