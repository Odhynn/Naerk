[[Whistor]]'s commander-in-chief, named Kuthnor, assumed the kingship temporarily after a coup that threw counselor [[Della]] and [[King Raldon]] into prison for betrayal of the people. A month later, a pirate ship appeared in port, demanding to see if Della was in good health, as well as demand the agreed upon tribute. Kuthnor not only refused to pay, saying that he had no knowledge of any tribute, but further threatened that if the pirates made any attack, he would not care for the lives of the king's sons at all, and would attack the pirates with all his might.

With [[King Raldon]] out of the picture, General Kuthnor took on the difficult task of getting Whistor into a state where it could be effectively defended against pirates. But this goal faced many obstacles. First of all, after a detailed inventory, a huge amount of the palace's wealth was missing from the raid on the royal treasury, almost half. In addition, many people had lost faith in the throne, so Kuthnor refused to proclaim himself king.

His task was particularly difficult: The army may have been numerically strong and properly equipped, but he had to solve huge logistic puzzles to supply it at regular intervals. The fleet was spread out in three points around Whistor, and ships constantly had to be sent with supplies. The warriors also had to be trained in maneuvers and complex orders, as most were completely inexperienced young men. All of this took time, which Kuthnor certainly did not have.

After a huge defeat of the royal navy in [[Malgoryn]] from pirates, [[Della]] appeared at the palace and addressed Kuthnor, telling him that she could help him if he appointed her as an advisor. Trapped in the face of the gradual destruction of his fleet, Kuthnor accepted, and Della began to learn Valus' plans and reveal them to Kuthnor. As a result of which his fleet was always prepared in the points where Valus attacked. Valus in turn, unable to identify the spy in his ranks, stopped the attacks, leaving Whistor unofficially ruled by a general and an advisor that few had imagined and even fewer trusted.
