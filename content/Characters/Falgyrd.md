A known archer and protagonist of [[Murder Hawk and Linnorm Hunter Saga]]. He prefers to stay out of the spotlight and hunt linnorms and beasts, as he has righteously earned the title Bolka, Linnorm Hunter. It is said he has slain over a dozen linnorms and defended [[Lampsir]] from numerous other dangers. He was elected Jarl and stoically accepted the tribes' leadership. He has an open enmity with [[Meegar]] Lurok.
