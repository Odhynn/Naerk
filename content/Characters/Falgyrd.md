Uncle of [[Klabbe]]
A known archer and protagonist of [[Murder Hawk and Linnorm Hunter Saga]]. He tried to deescalate his family's open rivalry with the Jargon family and proposed a [[Wedding Sacriledge}Wedding]] to unite them. Unfortunatelly, this wedding turned out to be a [[Skra]] provocation as an archer killed his soon-to-be wife [[Grilly]] and he tracked him down and killed him.

Since then, he prefers to stay out of the spotlight and hunt linnorms and beasts, as he has righteously earned the title Bolka, Linnorm Hunter. It is said he has slain over a dozen linnorms and defended [[Lampsir]] from numerous other dangers. He was elected Jarl and stoically accepted the tribes' leadership. He has an open enmity with [[Meegar]] Lurok.
