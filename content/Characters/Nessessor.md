A shadow creature that ruled the demiplane inside the [[Mirror of Souls]]. He was a [[Shadow Plane]] native that found a way to infiltrate the mirror and take command in it. In order to revenge baron [[Stephan]] who didn't reward his help, he unleashed forth [[The Blackthroat Disease]] in [[Marjalat]]. He was killed by [[Delishart]], [[Malthis]], [[Bjonnyr]] and [[Ludwig]] as they infiltrated the mirror and pierced its veil from within.
