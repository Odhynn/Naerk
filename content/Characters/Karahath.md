## History

Shortly before Karahath came to power, there were several succession circles in [[Kambah]], each playing its own political game. Karahath, even though a grandson of [[Fasroh]], was of commoner birth and few took his claims seriously. The advantage he had in relation to the others, however, was the support of the people. He stayed away from bureaucratic games, and was close to the problems of the world. There was great confidence in his person, and he took onto his side locals who were widely respected.

The nobles quickly realized that Karahath was very likely to take power and they didn't sit idly by: Assassins were hired to kill him by his political opponents, yet his bodyguards [[Nolgor]] Dalx and [[Almax]], protected him from certain death many times, and the few that failed, he was able to do it himself. All the murderers who survived were exemplarily punished in public, by the very mob that supported him. And soon everyone realized that it was impossible to stop his course by material means.

Then the idea came to ask for the help of [[Hell]] to depose him. High priests approached various [[archdevils]] and [[Sergonial]] associates, offering harsh but necessary rewards for their service. Of these, the most endearing to their cause proved to be [[Veiroch]]. In truth, Veiroch didn't want to take sides with anyone, but he took the opportunity to increase his influence in the [[Material Plane]]. And just like that, they opened a Gate to the east of [[Zaelvosh]]'s forest and called some of his strongest servants, among them [[Lovarnian]], a half-fiend tormentor who everyone trembled in his presence. He built a fortress there, [[Cossick]], in which he began torturing people and trading the information he learned. Cossick was built upon a village of elves that lived there, and hardly any elves survived the torture of being captured after an unequal battle.

[[Lovarnian]], in turn, chose a simple method of taking sides. He summoned both Karahath and the chieftains who had turned against him to Cossick one by one and arrested them. What he wanted was to see how convinced each one was of his cause, and to ascertain this he put them through cruel tortures. All but Karahath succumbed on the first day, with most giving up within the first hour. As for Karahath, he quickly grew to respect him, and released him on the third day after healing all the wounds he had inflicted on him.

When Karahath got out of there, many thought he wanted to go and surrender, and he simply walked to [[Aar]], with more and more people following him. His gaze was determined and his step steady. When he reached the city, he had tens of thousands following him. Then, reaching the gate, he killed whoever stood in his way, and reached the highest hill.

Karahath believed his grandfather [[Fasroh]] to be weak to enforce his rule as he grew old. He stepped into the throne room, killed him and claimed the [[Scrolls of the Supreme Tyrrant|Tyrrant Scroll]] for himself. Everyone accepted his leadership, as he held huge influence among the army and he carved in stone his new throne seat. There he carved in stone a throne, and officially became king of Kambah. As for his political opponents, they were never seen out of Cossick again, while Lovarnian became his general and close adviser in the coming battles. He united [[Kenorex]] and orcs under his rule and stopped the insurrections that were incited by elves and [[Berenfaer]] from the eastern provinces to the borders with [[Oventhart]]. He then formed a huge [[Defeated Army|army]] against [[Imtaria]]. He fought at [[Battle of Fherlon Plains]] and retreated after many orcs and goblins died. His [[Kenorex]] forces escorted him back to [[Kambah]].

After recovering from this failure, he reorganised his army overtime and [[War of Karahath|attacked]] [[Oventhart]]. After many battles, he gained control of [[Whitecross]] and some footholds on the southwestern Oventhart.

His ambitious son, [[Rongerak]], took the reigns of his new empire.
