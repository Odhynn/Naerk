## History

The grandson of [[Fasroh]], Karahath believed him to be weak to enforce his rule as he grew old. He stepped into the throne room, killed him and claimed the [[Scrolls of the Supreme Tyrrant|Tyrrant Scroll]] for himself. Everyone accepted his leadership, as he held huge influence among the army and he carved in stone his new throne seat. He united [[Kenorex]] and orcs under his rule and stopped the insurrections that were incited by elves and [[Berenfaer]] from the eastern provinces to the borders with [[Oventhart]]. He then formed a huge [[Defeated Army|army]] against [[Imtaria]]. He fought at [[Battle of Fherlon Plains]] and retreated after many orcs and goblins died. His [[Kenorex]] forces escorted him back to [[Kambah]].

After recovering from this failure, he reorganised his army overtime and [[War of Karahath|attacked]] [[Oventhart]]. After many battles, he gained control of [[Whitecross]] and some footholds on the southwestern Oventhart.

His ambitious son, [[Rongerak]], took the reigns of his new empire.
