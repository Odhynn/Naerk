A cleric and lawyer, native from [[Hell]] that joined the [[Halcyons]] in their adventures. After a trip in [[Athalaar]] that turned south, he opened a lawyer office in [[Hashnev]] called "Devil's Advocate". He became the Archpriest of the House of Glory temple of [[Sergonial]] after the death of [[Alkar the Black]]. He became a Counselor in [[Palaurim]] and proposed many reforms for the Alliance and the country. He strengthened the power of the temple and purged various spies who were working with the [[King Oodas|king]] and the [[Order of the Cave]]. He used his authority to put an end to the chaos in the city, as well as to meet some of [[Arbader]]'s tax obligations. He took part in the events of [[Hashnev, Revolt and Betrayal]]. After the unsuccesful revolt, he became the King's Regent until the King-in-Line would come of age.
