## History

Empress Oscia, the Second of Her Name, also known as "Silk", was already quite old when she took power. She was named after her great-great-grandmother [[Empress Oscia I]]. The last child of [[Emperor Nahal II|Emperor Nahal the Second]], one of the longest-lived emperors, she grew up in a relatively peaceful period for the country. She earned her nickname because she was particularly spoiled and grew up in the comforts and luxury of a sickening and toxic aristocracy circle. Nahal took great care of his daughters, but most agreed that it was too much as he was overprotective.

When her father was lost in his expedition to [[Athalahr]] to find her missing sister, she was the next and last in line of ascension and was officially crowned at the age of sixty-one. She proved completely incompetent of governing the vast empire, with constant quarrels between nobles and dukes and the army in decline. She was content to live in luxury, while the problems in the country grew. Whenever a rebellion broke out, she sent the army to suppress it, but soon entire regions refused to pay taxes and pirates started to threaten ships traveling south more and more frequently.

The power that Oscia had in her hands was enough to momentarily contain the various problems that arose, but she did not propose any substantial solutions. The army was not renewed, the coffers were empty, the borders were left undefended and in many barren regions famine prevailed. Such a situation was called upon to face by [[Emperor Kaldos IV|Kaldos the Fourth]], her only son and the last emperor of the Neruso dynasty.
