## Description

The current leader of [[Gheren Steed]], Delhans' skills at bow and horse are legendary. He commands respect amongst all nomads.

## History

He was born and raised a nomad in [[Three Horses]] and became a friend of [[Rotting]], as they practiced archery together. He restored his place in command and defended him after [[Voldrak]]'s death, while only a child. He proved to be a fast learner in the ways of the plains and quickly rose to the mercenary ranks.

## [[The Archery Contest of Lord Meeldas]]

He took part in [[The Archery Contest of Lord Meeldas]] and won [[Silien]] as well as [[Aeluril]], using only eight arrows for the ten apricots. His first shot tore through the first three apricots together, and all subsequent ones one each. With eight arrows, Delhan could now be fairly certain that he had no opponent, while Aeluril and Silien found their efforts futile. At the same time, the king valued the southerners and their rich plains, and felt that Delhan would be a very good diplomatic choice. His advisers were quick to agree.

Several more archers continued to shoot, but Delhan sat eating and drinking mockingly, confident that no one could reach him. His victory was almost certain and he was already lustfully glancing at the king's daughter, [[Veronica]], who was sitting next to the king and looking desperately at the drunkard in the stained silks. She knew in her heart that any elf or wayang would be better than this loser.

The sun was starting to go down for good when a furry northerner appeared. He was introduced to everyone as Voldosh. Most had no idea what it was and accepted his name, but the elves smiled, for they knew it was not a name but a title of [[VÃ¸lrad]]. Without further ado, the northerner headed to the stadium and strung his big bow. Delhan sat up and began to observe him carefully, for he had realized that his bow was even tougher than his own. Discussions died down as several realized the same and focused on the large archer.

The northerner took his time to calculate his targets and drew an arrow to his bow. His first shot tore through the second and third apricots together. Delhan sat up, but knew that from now on it would be difficult for the northerner to do the same again. The northerner with his second arrow dropped the fourth fruit, and with three more arrows the fifth, sixth and eighth. Delhan now knew that he was almost impossible to beat. He stood up and walked closer to Veronica, his eyes shining. He turned to see the last, futile efforts of the northerner.

He wasn't done though. he drew two arrows from his quiver, stooped down, shot the first, and immediately aimed up and shot the second. The first tore the first apricot and was thrown into the air, while the second tore the seventh, the ninth and struck the tenth, just as the first arrow fell from above and the two arrows met in the apricot. Everyone was speechless, seeing his feat, and the northerner casually went to the king and asked for his daughter's hand. [[Meeldas]], true to his word, declared him victorious as the sun set. [[Veronica]] ran to hug him, relieved to have escaped Delhan's teeth.
