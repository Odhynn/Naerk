## Description

The current leader of [[Gheren Steed]], Delhans' skills at bow and horse are legendary. He commands respect amongst all nomads.

## History

He was born and raised a nomad in [[Three Horses]] and became a friend of [[Rotting]], as they practiced archery together. He restored his place in command and defended him after [[Voldrak]]'s death, while only a child. He proved to be a fast learner in the ways of the plains and quickly rose to the mercenary ranks.
