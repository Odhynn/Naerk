The steadfast leader of the [[Bur'gg]] tribe. Daughter of the respected [[Jarl Haf]], she succeeded him by pure determination and sheer will. During the [[Totem Sundering]], she issued a call to arms to all who were worth fighting, and she herself led the first battles, fighting in the front lines. With several losses they were able to win the first battles, but it was obvious that the situation would soon get worse. Then, shamans intervened with seemingly succesful rituals. Darma never trusted the [[Twilight Veil]] intervention.
