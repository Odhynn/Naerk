A wise and compassionate cleric of [[Saekla]] that, after many decades of travels, inhabited [[Four Winds Monastery]] and soon ascended second-in-command after [[Oracle]]. His powerful spells could alter the weather and bring winged messengers all across [[Naerk]]. He led the defence of the Monastery at the [[War of the Titan]] and was convinced of the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]]'s pure intentions, also proven in battle. He decided to offer his aid, and also help against the [[Dumspergrond|Titan]]'s armies.

During the [[War of the Titan]], he fought against the giant force sent to awaken the [[Colossus]]. He was killed by greater [[demons]] in a heroic last stand.
