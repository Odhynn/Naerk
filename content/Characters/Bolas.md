A Fiendfolk, Bolas is mortal and the youngest of the nine archdevils of Hell. He is especially faithful and capable, as he often goes, as a mortal, to the material dimension for various jobs. Bolas had recently replaced the previous lord, the ambitious [[Raptazeal]], following a failed coup attempt by the latter in the year 4467. Raptazeal had closed all Malfeus' gates and threatened to block all soul traffic to and from Cocitus, and that he would raise a personal army to depose [[Sergonial]]. After a relatively short duel, he died a martyr's death. His skull is on display today in Sergonial's palace.
