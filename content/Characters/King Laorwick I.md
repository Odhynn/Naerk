An old king of [[Arbader]] that orchestrated the invasion to [[South Darrok]] in a time when it was vulnerable and weakened. This caused the [[Decade War of Arbader and South Darrok]]. He hired the [[Crimson Steel]] to steal and bring him [[Kalvathron]], a powerful [[Styx]] helmet with powers of prediction and mind control. He wore it during the war to gain advantages against the armies of [[South Darrok]].

He began to interrogate prisoners and with a simple touch he learned everything they were hiding, even if they did not want to tell him. He was able to learn South Darrok's command, generals, and forces, and soon his forces began to evade the traps set by [[Torris]]. This was succesful after several months though, as the first prisoners from Llykavann were unaware of the new general's plans and had to find prisoners from subsequent battles.

He also learned about the composition of the enemy troops and found that there were quite a few disputes between some battalions of different races, mainly elves/gnomes and humans/dwarves. The cunning king did not leave this unexploited. He sent disguised members of the Crimson Steel into [[Mennis]]' army and they began to sow the seeds of discord. The soldiers were told that some companies were receiving special treatment or that some were cowards, and as a result his battalions began to become dysfunctional.

Laorwick's plan was to stop the attacks for a while and for the [[Crimson Steel]] to take over and assassinate Torris from within as a result of the accumulated resentment towards his person. Indeed, several disgruntled men attempted to rebel against the "imported" general, as they called him. The majority of these were dwarves, some of whom had been brought as prisoners before Laorwick and had been brainwashed by his lies, and there were also a number of hidden Crimson Steel. The dwarven rebellion took place early the following year.

He organized the death of the general, however the people of [[South Darrok]] were furious after his death. A halfling named [[Jade]] personaly humiliated him by breaking his defence and resupplying the governor's tower in [[Llykavann]].

Somehow, by the beginning of 4595, Darrok found himself besieging Llykavann and Arbader struggling to hold even that. The tactics of previous years seemed futile now. The losses were enormous and could not be easily replaced. King Laorwick now continued to reinforce the city by sea to withstand the siege while the cyclops kept the attackers outside the walls with huge catapults. Both armies were exhausted by the constant fighting, and so the siege was destined to last a long time.

In total, the fighting for Llykavann continued for five years, until a Peace Treaty was finally signed. It was obvious that no one could change the borders drastically anymore and for Arbader the capital was costing more than it could bear. Llykavann was returned to Darrok and the warriors of the governor's garrison were named heroes of the country. Arbader retained all the lands in the southern plains of Larata and also claimed the city of [[Pangral]], which it had occupied since the beginning of the war. The remaining countries of [[Palaurim]] acted as guarantors for the implementation of the Treaty and so in the year 4601 the last of Arbader's forces returned south.
