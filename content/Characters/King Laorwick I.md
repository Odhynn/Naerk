An old king of [[Arbader]] that orchestrated the invasion to [[South Darrok]] in a time when it was vulnerable and weakened. This caused the [[Decade War of Arbader and South Darrok]]. He hired the [[Crimson Steel]] to steal and bring him [[Kalvathron]], a powerful [[Styx]] helmet with powers of prediction and mind control. He wore it during the war to gain advantages against the armies of [[South Darrok]].

He began to interrogate prisoners and with a simple touch he learned everything they were hiding, even if they did not want to tell him. He was able to learn South Darrok's command, generals, and forces, and soon his forces began to evade the traps set by [[Torris]]. This was succesful after several months though, as the first prisoners from Llykavann were unaware of the new general's plans and had to find prisoners from subsequent battles.

He also learned about the composition of the enemy troops and found that there were quite a few disputes between some battalions of different races, mainly elves/gnomes and humans/dwarves. The cunning king did not leave this unexploited. He sent disguised members of the Crimson Steel into [[Mennis]]' army and they began to sow the seeds of discord. The soldiers were told that some companies were receiving special treatment or that some were cowards, and as a result his battalions began to become dysfunctional.

Laorwick's plan was to stop the attacks for a while and for the [[Crimson Steel]] to take over and assassinate Torris from within as a result of the accumulated resentment towards his person. Indeed, several disgruntled men attempted to rebel against the "imported" general, as they called him. The majority of these were dwarves, some of whom had been brought as prisoners before Laorwick and had been brainwashed by his lies, and there were also a number of hidden Crimson Steel. The dwarven rebellion took place early the following year.

He organized the death of the general, however the people of [[South Darrok]] were furious after his death. A halfling named [[Jade]] personaly humiliated him by breaking his defence and resupplying the governor's tower in [[Llykavann]].
