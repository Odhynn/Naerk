The first Erinya, Glacya's arrival attracted many Erinyes, Nemesis and Shadow devils. She was once an angel of Sigard and decided to convert when a sorcerer who summoned her to the material dimension asked her to kill the entire population of a village in [[Darrok]] to contain a contagious disease. Glacya has since ended up in Hell and has become one of [[Sergonial]]'s most loyal and powerful followers, and is feared and shunned by most devils.
