The winter witch that helped the essence of [[Fallfaunt]] escape [[Hydarax]]'s prison and appear on the [[Material Plane]], in exchange for the power of ice magic. This caused the [[Winter's War]], a massive outbreak of cold and ice that froze the south half of the world. Her Icebringer forces marched from south pole causing massive battles and loss of life, while the rest of the world made a Grand Alliance and eventually stopped her after a fierce battle at [[Oromil]].

A [[Serafina]]'s powerful spell destroyed the Avatar, but the witch was not dead. A defensive spell Tayra had prepared in case of emergency transported her to the South Pole, where it all began. Along with her traveled [[Ashiro]] and Yøll, who had managed to enter the frozen carcass at the time, as well as the now defeated remnant of Fallfaunt. The witch, after a fierce battle, drew power from the strongest spells she knew, rose into the air in a storm, and froze Ashiro and Yoll into pillars of ice.

Then Yøll's gaze in the storm pointed out Tayra had unwittingly summoned [[Drokasner]], wandering wildly. Infuriating him, he asked him how he agreed to serve the Witch, and a goddess from the [[Elemental Ring]], as an [[Aspect]]. Drokasner pushed Tayra aside and prepared, charging a bolt of lightning, to finish off Yoll, when he showed the snow and ice all around them, the essence of Fallfaunt. _"[[Fallfaunt|Snow's Softness]]"_ Groaned the barbarian. _"[[Drokasner|Thunderstrike]]. You are one and the same."_

A bolt of lightning destroyed Yoll's ice pillar and knocked him down, sprawling, but he was still alive. His armor, the [[Aegis of the Storm]], had held. He had fallen beside the witch, and was still holding [[Vålnir]]: With a leap, he reached beside her and drove the sword into her chest, knocking her down and impaling it into the ice. He looked at Ashiro, who had also broken free and was futilely fighting the elements of nature, ice and lightning, that were ready to destroy him.

He cried, with his last breath, and all the [[Aspects]] witnessed him. _"Flee back to [[Evergrowing Forest]]. Your purpose here is over. The Winter's War is over."_ He collapsed next to the dead Tayra, his words falling heavy on the Aspects. The [[Icebringers]] melted away in seconds, while the [[Aspects]] all returned to the [[Evergrowing Forest]]: And with them [[Fallfaunt]] returned, to take the place and home she never had, among them: as if she had lived there forever.

Within two days, most of the ice had melted and the climate was restored to normal.
