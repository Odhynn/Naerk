**General Ildish Tetharyn** is one of the most famous figures of [[South Darrok]] and a loyal friend of [[Labelas Lionhead]]. A calm, restrained and calculated strategist, he fought in at least four different wars and numerous battles and his abilities is one of the biggest reasons why his country stood firm at the last centuries.

## History

Ildish was born and lived in Ekteron, and studied in the magical academy there. His studies also combined the use of the sword and martial arts. His first battles were as a captain at [[Bloodline Wars]]. After the war he was promoted to major and he organised a regiment of elves and spellcasters. His next test was the [[Decade War]] against [[Arbader]]. He learned many strategies in battle while fighting with general [[Torris Lionhead]], the grandfather of Labelas. Afterwards, he fought against the rebelious town of [[Khalaram]] and on the [[War of the Titan]].
