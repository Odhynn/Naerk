>The [[Ekteron]] war council received almost hourly reports of destruction in villages, mines and fields. This in itself meant that the process lasted from morning to night, without a break.
>Under normal circumstances, Ildish would have had no reason to worry. They had easily and quickly dealt with threats from the mountains in the past, and as an elf his memory went back centuries. But now the third and seventh companies that had been sent had suffered an unprecedented defeat.
>Especially the third company, who had personally trained them, had no reason to believe that he would not be able to deal with a threat from a few giants. But here he had been wrong, and now all the representatives of the council were each analyzing in their own charge how important it was that the entire army should come immediately to protect their area. Because above all, in [[South Darrok]] everyone had the right to their opinion.
>The army does not arrive in this case. When the ground explodes and huge creatures fly out of it, when the warriors melt from boulders before they even see the enemy, when the chariots are filled with dozens of the dead, then it is clear that the army is not enough.
>Is there another way to deal with the threat? Perhaps. It's that [[Oracle|witch]], in the mountain temple. Ildish had been there before, when in his youth he had greedily sought magic, to no avail. Now, he would climb the mountain again, though he loathed the prospect. Maybe if the place isn't leveled it might help.
>Or, know someone who can help. Surely he will know. Nothing escapes her. But then, if he knows about the raids, wouldn't he have already done something?
>These wizards are all greedy and selfish. After putting his captain in charge, he went to his room, recalled the area and teleported to the mountain. Then, with a second spell, he unfurled silver wings from his shoulders and flew to the top. These wizards are all greedy and selfish. Although he momentarily cursed himself for not furthering his studies in magic. Any spell would be useful now.

**General Ildish Tetharyn** is one of the most famous figures of [[South Darrok]] and a loyal friend of [[Labelas Lionhead]]. A calm, restrained and calculated strategist, he fought in at least four different wars and numerous battles and his abilities is one of the biggest reasons why his country stood firm at the last centuries.

## History

Ildish was born and lived in Ekteron, and studied in the magical academy there. His studies also combined the use of the sword and martial arts. His first battles were as a captain at [[Bloodline Wars]]. After the war he was promoted to major and he organised a regiment of elves and spellcasters. His next test was the [[Decade War]] against [[Arbader]]. He learned many strategies in battle while fighting with general [[Torris Lionhead]], the grandfather of Labelas. Afterwards, he fought against the rebelious town of [[Khalaram]] to no avail and on the [[War of the Titan]] where he defeated the giant armies on several fronts.
