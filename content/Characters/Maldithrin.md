A cunning creature arrived at the palace of [[Verhalith]] during [[Queen Vellanie]]'s grief. A one-eyed, bat-winged beast who changed shapes and managed to trick the queen into becoming her advisor. As time passed, he managed to sideline all of her close servants and advisors and had them banished, imprisoned, or summarily executed.

Maldithrin fed on the queen's frustration, and remained in the palace like a parasite. Gradually, as the palace tree, Azureleaf strengthened the palace walls, it became completely cut off from the outside world, and acquired its own microclimate: Static, endless, and full of negative emotions. Inside the palace, time seemed to have stopped, the queen lost track of the days, and Maldithrin practically took over the entire administration of the kingdom. He made sure that no one bothered her and limited her appearances to a minimum. He brought his own guard, various exiles and criminals of the [[Evergrowing Forest]], as well as undead guards and spirits.

The very existence of the palace was tied to Azureleaf, and he in turn believed that Maldithrin was the queen's friend, and protected her: but he used her tears to water the tree and gradually Azureleaf began to acquire Maldithrin's perspective, as time passed. The decades became centuries and the centuries became millennia, and the queen remained in his control, while the tree had now become his ally and sought victims to feed on their negative emotions. Those who challenged Maldithrin and his authority ended up in prison, and the most audacious were tortured or executed, or worse, turned into deformed beasts, slaves to his whims.

In the year 4727, a wizard traveling through the city saw a painting of the queen on a canvas and was fascinated. With a divination spell he was able to see her, locked and desperate in the tower, and fell in love with her. He decided to send her a letter expressing his feelings in the form of a poem, but it never reached her, as Maldithrin controlled all the documents that reached her. So, he found three local adventurers, a catfolk and two fairies to deliver the letter, emphasizing that it was strictly for her. [[Talyrian]] gradually gained an interest in the messengers and began to watch closely, but she could not interfere. She was their protector and the message had to arrive, but she could not enter the palace.

The three messengers secretly entered the palace through the sewers, through a route that an former escapee had found. They fought Maldithrin's guards and the palace defenses to ascend to the higher levels. They freed the prisoners, and after hide-and-seek, fighting, and chasing, they reached the queen's chambers where Maldithrin attacked them, determined to prevent them from delivering the letter at all costs. They severely wounded him with the help of a palace guard and drove him off. He sought refuge at the top of the palace, where Azureleaf had taken root.

Thus, the letter reached the queen, and she, reading it, emerged from the oblivion she had been in for so long. Slowly, the palace defenses receded and time began to flow normally. The queen gradually realized what had happened, but she needed time. The messengers reached the top, where they fought the corrupted Azureleaf, and killed Maldithrin that had taken refuge in its branches. After a fierce battle, the tree, scorched and cut down, wrapped, choked and killed the messengers with its roots, sucking the life out of them. However, they managed to purify it, cutting off the branches that Maldithrin had poisoned, and together with the queen, it gradually found its old lost self.
