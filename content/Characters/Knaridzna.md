A huge [[Demon]] lord that was frequently summoned by the [[Demonslaver]] wizard [[Anthis]]. He orchestrated along with the other members of the [[Vile Septet]] a thwart on a [[Portal]] [[Anthis]] opened at [[Pyrlon]]'s summoning tower. This allowed the portal to remain open and the forces of the [[Abyss]] to invade en masse the island of [[Olgizmar]] and destroy the [[Demonslavers]] on the south part of the island. He commanded a big part of the vanguard. He had not had enough of the destruction of the city, and he thirsted for new conquests.
