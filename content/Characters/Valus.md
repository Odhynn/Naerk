The cruel and sadistic pirate lord of [[Flame Gulf]] and member of the [[Pirate Council]]. His flag is a Jester Hat in a Trident.

When Della, another captain of the Council, took on the task to weaken [[Whistor]] for a pirate invasion after [[King Raldon]]'s death, he disagreed. he believed that the island should not be given time to organize its army, and he feared that Della would take all the spoils of the island alone. Already, only a small portion of the king's treasury from a recent heist had ended up in Valus' hands, and he had every reason to suspect her.

Without warning, the first battles began in [[Malgoryn]] to the north and on the [[Walgri Isles]]. Losses were enormous on both sides, but Valus gradually gained the advantage, as he was an experienced captain, while eventually he had enough undead among his sailors that the mere sight of them made Whistor's young warriors dive into the sea. Fifty of Whistor's galleys were destroyed, while Valus lost only twenty-two smaller ones.

However, the [[Whistor]] fleet was always prepared and in force in the points where Valus attacked next. Valus in turn, unable to identify the spy in his ranks, stopped the attacks on [[Whistor]] for five years.

In the summer of 4817, he had regrouped and amassed more ships and undead sailors. He started raids on the smaller [[Whistor]] islands and sent spy ships to gather information.
