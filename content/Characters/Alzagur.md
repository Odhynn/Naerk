A fiendfolk alchemist and member of the [[Vile Septet]]. He arrived last and went to the forest of [[Kolnutt]] to experiment and mutate with animals and plants. His experiments are believed to be responsible for the rapid acceleration of the demonic corruption of [[Olgizmar]], as well as the infamous [[Abyszmor]], Olgizmar's infamous demon plague that is contracted through Blood Rain.
