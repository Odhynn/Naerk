A fiendfolk alchemist and member of the [[Vile Septet]]. He arrived last and his experiments are believed to be responsible for the rapid acceleration of the demonic corruption of [[Olgizmar]], as well as the infamous [[Abyszmor]], Olgizmar's infamous demon plague that is contracted through Blood Rain.
