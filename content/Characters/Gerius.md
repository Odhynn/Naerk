Gerius was a rampaging werewolf of the [[Warclaw]]. He was among the oldest and most powerful werewolves, and even possessed druidic powers. Particularly ferocious, he had killed and maimed dozens of [[Huntsman]]'s rangers until he was eventually captured. He was sacrificed in a [[Rezal]] tree in a ritual that gave the hunters of [[Huntsman]] a more controlable form of the lycanthropy disease to use as a weapon, creating the first [[Silvertail]].
