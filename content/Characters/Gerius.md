## Background

Gerius was a rampaging werewolf of the [[Warclaw]]. He was among the oldest and most powerful werewolves, and even possessed druidic powers. Particularly ferocious, he had killed and maimed dozens of [[Huntsman]]'s rangers until he was eventually captured.

## [[Silvertail]] Ritual

He was sacrificed in a [[Rezal]] tree in a ritual that gave the hunters of [[Huntsman]] a more controlable form of the lycanthropy disease to use as a weapon, creating the first [[Silvertail]].

## Allyx

With the death of Gerius, many believed that one of the worst manifestations of lycanthropy had come to an end. But, despite those who believed so, Gerius survived after the ceremony of the Silvertails, the Huntsman's loyalists. On the next full moon his ghost rose and came out of his tomb. But he was no more a ghost: The reason he rose was the power of lycanthropy itself, which did not end with his death. His insatiable hunger and thirst for blood could not be stopped.

His spirit began to enter the bodies of local people as a host, and these in turn began to take on animal-like characteristics and display violent behavior and cannibalistic tendencies. Thus the spirit, sharing the senses of the body over which it had mastered, could again satisfy its hunger, since it itself had no physical substance. And spirits like this also appeared in other seemingly normal werewolves. These creatures were called Allyx.
