## [[The Arrival Wars]]

The lord of the Hida clan of Thunder in [[Sennarin]]. He focused on meeting the needs of the people in the south. He strengthened trade and agriculture in order to be able to cover all the nutritional needs of the inhabitants. Soon, however, he was called upon to face Bjåglant's raiders alone: ​​Lord Are [[Shinzou]] refused his plea for help, saying that he too had not helped him in the battles against the Oni to the north. Hida then realized that things were difficult. His warriors numbered barely eight thousand, while his scouts on land and sea estimated Bjåglant's forces at many times that number.

After the third invasion and ensuing battle with numerous Are clan losses, he was deemed a traitor and incompetent by Lord Are [[Shinzou]]. He gave him three days' respite to give up [[Shiliage]], his seat in the port, and go into exile from [[Sennarin]]. Then many of the Hida clan suggested that Ishigaki strike first: Gather his now larger army and make a surprise attack at night. But Hida, loyal to the law, refused. He gathered his warriors and prepared five ships to leave, with his Samurai loyalists. But the next morning he saw that he was followed by many more than he had expected: forty-two other ships, full of his loyal soldiers, who had fought with him in many battles and refused to desert him. So ex-Lord [[Hida]] first set sail for [[Stormsfall]], and most of the exiles stayed with him.

## Exile

As an exile, he began offering his services as a mercenary, but still maintained a code of honor in his dealings as well. Quickly, his warriors distinguished themselves in many battles throughout the [[Lokkam Sea]] and even further south, in the [[Starlit Ocean]], [[Reisdok]] and even [[Whistor]]. Then they were called the [[Wolf Legion]], after the wolf of the Hida clan: And many warriors were enlisted among them, so that their strength was constantly renewed.

News of their whereabouts reached back to [[Sennarin]], and the Clans of Thunder. In the countryside and in the cities, whispers began to be made that they wanted revenge: All this reached the ears of Are, who was keeping half an eye on the Wolf Legion. Then, in the year 4801, assassins attacked the Hida clan exiles, killing several, with Ishigaki himself narrowly escaping death. No one knew the origin of the assassins, and lord Are denied any involvement in it. But the Wolf Legion broke into five separate divisions, which scattered across [[Reisdok]], [[Whistor]], [[Mestaxon]], [[Stormsfall]], and [[Nolgot]]. There they continued their mercenary work, but all the remaining of the original faction made a promise to meet again in twenty years and take revenge on the lord Are [[Shizou]], as they were now sure that he had sent the assassins.
