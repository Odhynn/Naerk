The father of [[Dimma]] and step-grandfather of [[Granit]]. He had come into great conflict with the then Jarl. The authority of the tribe wanted to prohibit the worship of certain [[Aspects]] that they found working against the good functioning of the tribe. Aegir was the only one who openly opposed them, and even challenged the Jarl to a duel for it, losing his eye but winning. As a sign of gratitude, the two [[Aspects]] that would be prohibited, [[Berohath]] and [[Valanshore]], appeared before him, and promised him that if he or his descendants were in mortal danger, they would intervene to save them.
