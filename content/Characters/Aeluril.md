The third best archer of [[Oventhart]] and second-in-command of [[Ghostwatch]]. He spends most of his time in [[Blackwoods]].

He participated in [[The Archery Contest of Lord Meeldas]] and was the first to succeed the trial, using nine arrows to hit ten apricots. Eventually, he lost to [[Delhan Poglu]] and a [[Jarl Yuradal|furry northener]].
