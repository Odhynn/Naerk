A hairy, huge and unrelenting barbarian wielding a greataxe. He has travelled alongside [[Delishart]], [[Ludvig]] and [[Malthis]].

 With his companions, he ended [[The Blackthroat Disease]] and slew [[Nessessor]] in [[Marjalat]]. Later that year, he embarked a ship and sailed far west. He fought and killed the sea dragon [[Ozrallon]] at his journey in [[Drozzin]].
