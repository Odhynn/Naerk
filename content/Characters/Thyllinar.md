## History

Of all the known wizards, Thyllinar began his studies as a wizard quite late. As a young man, he served as an interpreter, scribe, and translator to the Baron of [[Kordash]]. Thyllinar had a habit of recording all his dreams and nightmares, while they were still fresh in his memory. He would often look back at his notes to find some reference points in his dreams, and soon he had written an entire fantasy world, with each subsequent dream expanding it.

The Baron, however, needed a wizard, and he did not trust any stranger. So, he sent the trusted Thyllinar, now 25 years old, to study magic and learn at least the basics to be able to help him. Thyllinar agreed and traveled to [[Ansivaal]], where there was a magic academy, and began his studies. He proved to be a very quick learner. Within two years he had learned many basic spells, but this was at the expense of the rest of his knowledge. At the same time, he returned to the baron every three months to help him with his administrative work. Thus, in the third and fourth years, his teachers focused his studies on the history of magic and the dimensions.

It was then that Thyllinar understood what the [[Dreamworld]] was. He noticed the impressive way it worked and wondered for the first time what was happening to his own dreams, which even during his studies he had not neglected to record in his diary. One day, he found a scroll in the library with a spell that he understood that with the correct articulation during its recitation, it would transport him to the Dreamworld.

Thyllinar secretly took the scroll and hid it in his room, as he knew that it needed the proper preparation to be used correctly. The Dreamworld was vast and he wanted to go to his own region, the one he had created. He was very curious to see what it really was like. After a few months, as he entered his fifth year of study, he was able to change the parameters and some words on the scroll to travel wherever he wanted. Once he was sure of what he wanted to do, he said he would go to the baron for a month, and instead, he rented a house in Ansivaal and read the scroll with the changes he made.

Immediately, he was transported to the [[Dreamworld]]. He found himself in a silver castle that he had dreamed of for a long time: He realised immediately that all the places he had dreamed of existed. He took out his diary to consult it and began to travel his world, which he had learned so well by now. He began to suspect that all the monsters and nightmares he had dreamed of were also real. His fears soon became reality, as throughout the area in and around his imaginary world, there were his nightmares, who could roam and harass the neighboring sleeping souls.

He soon realized that he had absolute control over his nightmares. Anything he had written in his diary, he was able to teleport it elsewhere, to make it disappear or even duplicate it, within certain limits. He felt like a king in his castle, until, wandering around, he found a nightmare that taunted and accused him of his actions. He interrogated him by using his control over him, and realized that his nightmares, although his creations, had intelligence. Even more, he realized that there were also Wayangs from the [[Twalar]] inside his castle, who sought refuge from the hunters of [[Voolthow]].

The wizard did not waste a moment. He was able to gather all the Twalar in the most strategic places of his castle and used the nightmares for his defenses. Huge worms and bats, made of shadows, began the attack on his castle, and an army of [[Voolthow]] warriors followed behind. Thyllinar promised the Twalar leader, [[Avarissa]] Flydron, that if they won the battle, the fortress would be as much theirs as his. He leafed through his diary, and called upon all the nightmares he had created over the years to help him. Huge dragons and sphinxes rushed at the army from the battlements, while hordes of archers fired barbed arrows and snakes spewed fire from holes in the towers. Swarms of spiders appeared on the walls and began to eat anyone who climbed. The attackers, who were a huge army, were forced to retreat before the inexhaustible power of Thyllinar's creatures. The battle was won, and the Twalar humbly thanked him.

All this had happened in one night. It was a very restless night in [[Ansivaal]], in which no one in the city slept. All the inhabitants saw terrifying nightmares as soon as they closed their eyes, and woke up bathed in cold sweat. In the morning, Thyllinar returned to the academy and asked curiously what day it was, only to find out that one day has passed. His question aroused the suspicion of the wizards, who quickly realized the loss of the papyrus and his actions during the night, and summarily dismissed him from the academy for life, as punishment for using magic he did not know, as well as for the theft and for the suffering of the local inhabitants.

But Thyllinar had not been disappointed. He returned to [[Kordash]] knowing that he had managed to tame his own dreams and an entire dimension. He began to study on his own terms and design evocation and transmutation spells, delighted by his successes. His efforts took many years, but he was able to find answers and create many spells in that time, with many trips to the Dreamworld in between. At times, he was targeted by shadow assassins, but he was always one step ahead of his pursuers, and soon knew or created enough spells to protect himself.

## [[Arsinoe]] and [[Cornuzel]]

He eventually established his position as the most powerful wizard in Reisdok. The arrival of [[Arsinoe]] in 3486 came to challenge this position, but, contrary to what everyone believed, the two of them married and founded the powerful [[Cornuzel]] magic academy. The councils of the Cornuzel archwizards are held in Thyllinar's castle in the Dreamworld, which is the safest place they know. As a sign of respect, everyone there speaks in whispers or telepathically, so as not to disturb the sleeping fireflies around them. Soon, the Cornuzel became friendly with the [[Twalar]], and several agreed to help them in the battles against [[Voolthow]].
