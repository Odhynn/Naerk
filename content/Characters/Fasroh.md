## History

The First Tyrrant, Fasroh originally was an [[Oventhart]] general garissoned in [[Aar]]. A war veteran in many battles against his kin, he took the [[Scrolls of the Supreme Tyrrant]] and formed the laws that [[Kambah]] is still ruled today. He started a campaign to dominate all the orc tribes in the area and won many battles in the region. Fasroh broke every treaty and submission to Oventhart and began to spread his iron grip. During his reign, Kambah gained most of its territory. Oventhart was initially shocked and unable to bring Kambah back under his control and only the military might of Imtaria and Emperor [[Ilarein]] could stop him. Then it is said that the legendary rivalry between the two countries began, which was to last for many decades.

He was killed in 4756 by his grandson, [[Karahath]], who took over his place.
