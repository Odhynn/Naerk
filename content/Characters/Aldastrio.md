The legendary stone wizard and part of the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]]. He antagonized [[Salkor]] at his quest to reclaim the [[Rod of Stone and Steel]] and was killed by [[demon]] and [[Bloodscale]] forces while tracking him on his way to [[Tartara]]. He was ressurected by [[Tarov]] and was given a new purpose: to protect the [[Roaring Diamond]] and the creatures of the earth. He was given a familiar, [[Glasvir]], and subsequently fought against [[Dumspergrond]] and his forces at the [[War of the Titan]]. He stopped [[Hossoth]]'s effort to awaken a stone [[Colossus]] and succeeded into binding him to his will. After [[Rhekvethor]] was freed, it was agreed that he be given the Rod for safekeeping and for sensible use.
