## Edhellin downfall

The most powerful wizard of the [[Edhellin]] at the peak of their civilization. He deviced a powerful reality/time - alteration spell that turned back time 7 days for for the elves to prevent a fire that burned half of the [[Edhelwood]] forest and almost completely destroyed the fauna of the area.

When factions were formed as corruption from [[Vaelasil]] affected the king and the nation, Sylris called the faction leaders and the king to a council. He addressed them inquiring why all this strife was happening and what it was for. He then saw the king rise menacingly and accuse him of betraying the [[Edhellin]] nation, as he believed that the only reason the council was called is because of Sylris' personal ambitions.

Sylris coldly replied, _"You are out of your mind! This orb you hold in your hands will ultimately bring about the destruction of our race!"_

Erlamin's mocking reply was, _"Really, you think you're going to influence my government with baseless accusations? Is this all happening because you want it to? The orb to come into your possession?"_

Erlamin recognizing how dangerous a rival Sylris could make for his power, revoked him as a traitor to the Edhellin, an ally of humans and dragons (as he maintained excellent relations with dragons as well as human kings). Thus Sylris became the first exile of the [[Edhellin]] at the year -1603.

## Vaelasil

Just a few days after the council failed, a bewildered Sylris, trying to find a solution to the impasse in which Edhellin society has fallen, seeked out his good friend [[Nentha]] -an all-wise and powerful gold wyrm- for advice. The meeting took place on [[Sunshine]] island where Nentha still lives today. [[Nentha]] as he was informed of the situation, decided that the Elven king should be dethroned immediately, because his thirst for power would cause problems that would become uncontrollable and possibly a war of enormous scope could be caused that would leave the whole Naerk ruined. Therefore, the solution he proposed had to be drastic, without at the same time running the risk of a diplomatic episode between the dragons and the Edhellin. Therefore, he came up with the idea that Sylris would have to steal the orb himself and learn how to use it. So Nentha's identity had to be kept a secret until the end of the mission.

The preparation for stealing the orb took almost 50 years. In -1550 Sylris was ready to make his move. This was made really easy since Sylris was the strongest time mage to ever set foot in [[Naerk]]. So he returned to the Edhellin realm and before the Elf king could attack him himself, Sylris stopped time for about 5 minutes to remove the orb from the Elf king's possession. He immediately escaped and the greatest manhunt the world had ever seen took place. Hundreds of Edhellin had swarmed all over Naerk trying to locate Sylris in order to retrieve the orb. There was absolutely no safe place for Sylris and as if it wasn't enough that he had to find safe haven, he also needed time to learn how to use the orb.

Nentha and Sylris' first thought was to destroy the orb. Alas, even with the most powerful spells that these powerful entities had at their disposal, destroying the orb was not possible. Therefore, Sylris' only choice was to learn how to use this powerful weapon and quickly, before the war breaks out. Being desperate, Nentha had a very risky idea that could, under conditions, work. Nentha had no special abilities to perform powerful space-time magic spells, but he knew very well how the planes outside the material plane are structured. So the two of them cast a spell that even by the standards of the gods was completely unimaginable. They created a hole in space-time and went into a new orbit with it. The spell became known in history as Temporal Streamline Jump.

The result of this action was that they were washed into a parallel reality where the concept of time had no meaning at all. There, they began to study the orb's properties and conduct experiments. It occurred to them to abandon the orb in this dimension and go back, but in the end it was never an option, since the corruption of the Elf king had reached such a state that the start of war seemed inevitable. The only way out was his death. But there was one main problem. In addition to being immortal, the Elf king possessed such powerful destructive magic that it would be a great challenge even to Nentha's strength. Besides, Sylris was no warrior. He had never been involved in developing destructive magic.

After hundreds of years of being in the other dimension (having only spent moments on the [[Material Plane]]) they came to realize that the orb's true use was its ability to open vortices in the transparent mantle that separated the Material Plane from the [[Etherial Plane]]. This gave them automatically an idea of ​​how they could proceed in the battle. The centuries that passed until he learned to use the orb corrupted him enough, but with the help of Nentha he managed to keep his sanity and not be distracted by his purpose. But it would be safe to say that Sylris now had less pure intentions and more of a thirst for revenge on the [[King Erlamin|Elf king]].

## [[Day of Wild Magic]] and Aftermath

This caused the events of the [[Day of Wild Magic]], and after a battle with severe fallout, he returned to his people and tried to reform their society. Most people embraced his dedication to correcting their false ways as a society, but already the elves have lost their immortality. Despite this the trade relations between their neighbor civilizations were good and Sylris made frequent trips to help diplomatically as well as materially. He knew that to make his plan work he needed the support of the other people. The political walls that had been erected between civilizations were not easy to remove.

In the late 15th century before the [[Ghost War]], Sylris saw that humans were spending far more on building and raising an army than on developing their civilization. But he could not, now that Edhellin society had found its social cohesion, prepare it for eventual war. All the effort would end in futility as hatred would dominate reason once again. So he chose to take the risk of not alerting the Edhellin, given that the elves were still able to repel a potential attack. The only measure he suggested was for them to start reproducing at a much higher rate since they were now mortal. He tried to calm all sides and avoid a war, an effort that only prolongued the imminent attack.

## [[Edhelwood Invasion]]

Humans though were looking for the slightest reason to start a war. This was made possible after bribing the remnants of [[Virdithas]]' faction, who went and retrieved the artifacts located in [[Windhill]]. The orcs allied themselves with the humans and in -1330 they invaded the [[Edhelwood]]. The regions that made up the alliance were [[Tithlon]] and the orcs of [[Allwick]] and the [[Rammok Wastes]]. Sylris again asked for a council arguing that there had been treachery and there was no reason to start a war, but there were no listening ears. With no other choice to stop the war he went to his friend [[Nentha]] to ask for help. He asked him to have the dragons side with the elves to prevent battle. Nentha was willing to help, but the other dragons warned him not to get involved in the humans' wars, as such an action would encourage evil dragons to join the battle as well or that [[Sunshine]] would be next. This is the last thing Sylris would want, so he left the island without receiving any help to prepare for battle.  Sylris' foreign policy choices had ultimately diminished his popularity among the Edhellin ranks as many saw all this defensiveness and compromise in the face of people's challenges as a possible betrayal.

[[Edhelwood]] proved to be a dangerous battleground for invaders. The elves knew the forest very well, which they had filled with traps. It was also a good place for ambushes, since the elves' flexible bodies and developed vision gave them a distinct advantage in battle. By -1325 the elves were defending exemplary, but their supplies were running low. In -1323 the tide had turned to the human side, but within that two years the elven wizards had built a fortress in [[Ilidran]], then-capital of Naryal. In the seven-year period, there was great dissension in the ranks of the Edhellin. The main reason for this quarrel was Sylris. Almost all elves now considered him a traitor. The more difficult the situation became for the elves, the more Sylris' reputation declined, until there were public calls for his beheading as redemption for the suffering he had brought upon them. In -1320 the war ended in a humiliating defeat for the elves. Most of Naryal had been destroyed after a bloody war. The orcs and humans enslaved all the elves they captured in battle. Several of them escaped to the north, others built boats and crossed the [[Roaring Strait]] and the [[Misty Sea]]. Additionally some had begun digging underground burrows to escape underground by -1323.

Sylris, foreseeing the impending defeat, and receiving an outcry from the greater part of the elvehnan, left Naryal with about a hundred followers bound for [[Sunshine]]. This happened in -1322. Since then, his tracks are lost.
