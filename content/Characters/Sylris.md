## Edhellin downfall

The most powerful wizard of the [[Edhellin]] at the peak of their civilization. He deviced a powerful reality/time - alteration spell that turned back time 7 days for for the elves to prevent a fire that burned half of the [[Edhelwood]] forest and almost completely destroyed the fauna of the area.

When factions were formed as corruption from [[Vaelasil]] affected the king and the nation, Sylris called the faction leaders and the king to a council. He addressed them inquiring why all this strife was happening and what it was for. He then saw the king rise menacingly and accuse him of betraying the [[Edhellin]] nation, as he believed that the only reason the council was called is because of Sylris' personal ambitions.

Sylris coldly replied, _"You are out of your mind! This orb you hold in your hands will ultimately bring about the destruction of our race!"_

Erlamin's mocking reply was, _"Really, you think you're going to influence my government with baseless accusations? Is this all happening because you want it to? The orb to come into your possession?"_

Erlamin recognizing how dangerous a rival Sylris could make for his power, revoked him as a traitor to the Edhellin, an ally of humans and dragons (as he maintained excellent relations with dragons as well as human kings). Thus Sylris became the first exile of the [[Edhellin]] at the year -1603.

## Vaelasil

Just a few days after the council failed, a bewildered Sylris, trying to find a solution to the impasse in which Edhellin society has fallen, seeked out his good friend [[Nentha]] -an all-wise and powerful gold wyrm- for advice. The meeting took place on [[Sunshine]] island where Nentha still lives today. [[Nentha]] as he was informed of the situation, decided that the Elven king should be dethroned immediately, because his thirst for power would cause problems that would become uncontrollable and possibly a war of enormous scope could be caused that would leave the whole Naerk ruined. Therefore, the solution he proposed had to be drastic, without at the same time running the risk of a diplomatic episode between the dragons and the Edhellin. Therefore, he came up with the idea that Sylris would have to steal the orb himself and learn how to use it. So Nentha's identity had to be kept a secret until the end of the mission.

The preparation for stealing the orb took almost 50 years. In -1550 Sylris was ready to make his move. This was made really easy since Sylris was the strongest time mage to ever set foot in [[Naerk]]. So he returned to the Edhellin realm and before the Elf king could attack him himself, Sylris stopped time for about 5 minutes to remove the orb from the Elf king's possession. He immediately escaped and the greatest manhunt the world had ever seen took place. Hundreds of Edhellin had swarmed all over Naerk trying to locate Sylris in order to retrieve the orb. There was absolutely no safe place for Sylris and as if it wasn't enough that he had to find safe haven, he also needed time to learn how to use the orb.

Nentha and Sylris' first thought was to destroy the orb. Alas, even with the most powerful spells that these powerful entities had at their disposal, destroying the orb was not possible. Therefore, Sylris' only choice was to learn how to use this powerful weapon and quickly, before the war breaks out. Being desperate, Nentha had a very risky idea that could, under conditions, work. Nentha had no special abilities to perform powerful space-time magic spells, but he knew very well how the planes outside the material plane are structured. So the two of them cast a spell that even by the standards of the gods was completely unimaginable. They created a hole in space-time and went into a new orbit with it. The spell became known in history as Temporal Streamline Jump.

The result of this action was that they were washed into a parallel reality where the concept of time had no meaning at all. There, they began to study the orb's properties and conduct experiments. It occurred to them to abandon the orb in this dimension and go back, but in the end it was never an option, since the corruption of the Elf king had reached such a state that the start of war seemed inevitable. The only way out was his death. But there was one main problem. In addition to being immortal, the Elf king possessed such powerful destructive magic that it would be a great challenge even to Nentha's strength. Besides, Sylris was no warrior. He had never been involved in developing destructive magic.

After hundreds of years of being in the other dimension (having only spent moments on the [[Material Plane]]) they came to realize that the orb's true use was its ability to open vortices in the transparent mantle that separated the Material Plane from the [[Etherial Plane]]. This gave them automatically an idea of ​​how they could proceed in the battle. The centuries that passed until he learned to use the orb corrupted him enough, but with the help of Nentha he managed to keep his sanity and not be distracted by his purpose. But it would be safe to say that Sylris now had less pure intentions and more of a thirst for revenge on the [[King Erlamin|Elf king]].

## [[Day of Wild Magic]] and Aftermath

This caused the events of the [[Day of Wild Magic]], and after a battle with severe fallout, he returned to his people and tried to reform their society.
