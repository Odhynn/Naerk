The most powerful wizard of the [[Edhellin]] at the peak of their civilization. He deviced a powerful reality/time - alteration spell that turned back time 7 days for for the elves to prevent a fire that burned half of the [[Edhelwood]] forest and almost completely destroyed the fauna of the area.

When factions were formed as corruption from [[Vaelasil]] affected the king and the nation, Sylris called the faction leaders and the king to a council. He addressed them inquiring why all this strife was happening and what it was for. He then saw the king rise menacingly and accuse him of betraying the [[Edhellin]] nation, as he believed that the only reason the council was called is because of Sylris' personal ambitions.

Sylris coldly replied, _"You are out of your mind! This orb you hold in your hands will ultimately bring about the destruction of our race!"_

Erlamin's mocking reply was, _"Really, you think you're going to influence my government with baseless accusations? Is this all happening because you want it to? The orb to come into your possession?"_

Erlamin recognizing how dangerous a rival Sylris could make for his power, revoked him as a traitor to the Edhellin, an ally of humans and dragons (as he maintained excellent relations with dragons as well as human kings). Thus Sylris became the first exile of the [[Edhellin]].
