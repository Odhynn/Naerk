The ex-leader of [[Hurtvigsen]] in [[Hlafengrond]], a devoted guardian and friend of [[Jarl Forjod]]. They became friends after Olaff protected him from an ambush of twenty trolls. His word was well-respected in the north. As he tried to teach his children, [[Gyrtrud]] and [[Borlen]] how to fight with several weapons, he proved to be harsh in his lessons with them. He forced them to walk barefoot in the snow and mountains, climb rocks to get bird eggs, and duel with iron weapons from cubs. He thought he could toughen them up that way, but neither of his children seemed interested in the life of the warrior he was preparing for them.

On one of the Jarl's many journeys south, Olaff insisted that the children come with him, as followers. He was trying to teach them that as future [[Hurtvigsen]], they should always be at the Jarl's side to protect him with their lives if necessary. This journey proved to be very dangerous, as the locals wrongly believed them to be [[Nagstad]] raiders and attacked them. After a bloody last stand, the northeners were slaughtered one by one after their ship was burned. [[Jarl Forjod]] was captured for ransom. Olaff killed fifty six warriors of the locals before he was taken down.
