One of the five faction leaders at the decline of the [[Edhellin]] civilization. He was a powerful spellcaster able to cast the most destructive spells, while he created several by himself. His faction was the most powerful and enjoyed several unfair privileges. He took part in the battle at the [[Day of Wild Magic]] against the exiled archmage [[Sylris]] and was imprisoned eternally to [[Eruvim]].
