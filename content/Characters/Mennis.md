The brother of the general [[Torris]] Lionhead that fought in the [[Decade War of Arbader and South Darrok]]. He went with three battalions to defend the city of [[Relmon]] shortly after [[Llykavann]] fell. In a skirmish with his soldiers south of [[Relmon]], [[Arbader]]'s forces under Major Toldar feigned retreat and then counterattacked, resulting in over four hundred dead Darrok soldiers and a hundred prisoners. Mennis took this defeat personally and tried to regain momentum.

However, agents of the [[Crimson Steel]] were sent as disguised soldiers to Mennis' army and they began to sow the seeds of discord. The soldiers were told that some companies were receiving with special treatment or that some were cowards and as a result his battalions began to become dysfunctional.

When his brother Torris found himself retreating from Volprost with heavy losses, he asked for help from Mennis. Only two companies rushed to help, as many battalions had returned freed "prisoners" and spies who had begun to breed discord in the army. The majority did not trust Torris and considered that he did not have the luxury of asking for help as they said that his tactics were wrong and that he should hold out alone.
