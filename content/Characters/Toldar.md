A hobgoblin general of the [[Arbader]] forces during the [[Decade War of Arbader and South Darrok]]. He was very trusted by [[King Laorwick I]] and rumored as a great strategist.

In a skirmish with [[Mennis]]' soldiers south of [[Relmon]], [[Arbader]]'s forces underthe  General feigned retreat and then counterattacked, resulting in over four hundred dead Darrok soldiers and a hundred prisoners that he sent to [[King Laorwick I]]. Later in the war, he sent a strike team led by his sergeants [[Foba]] and [[Yargot]] to attack Captain [[Minthariel]]'s forces in an ancient fortress in [[Queenswood]]. They succeded and killed Minthariel, forcing the dwarven garrison to retreat. Exposed and vulnerable to attacks by bugbear and hobgoblin cavalry, the dwarf general [[Odr]] ordered Darrok's forces to retreat from the forest. Nearly two battalions of Darrok were slaughtered in a battle that was practically a total defeat.
