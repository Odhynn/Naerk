A giant orc bruiser and eldest son of [[Elder Gorhald]]. He is the leader of [[Dal'Vorag]]. Brother of [[Pineg]] and [[Hramm]].

One night, Gorhald called his sons to his tent. He told them the story of [[Grimson]], and that whoever brought him the skull would become chief of the clan in his place. The three brothers lost no opportunity to prove their worth and take command of the tribe, and next morning they prepared to leave for [[Legthir Pass]]. [[Koldrag]], a distant descendant of Grimson, led them to the pass after a long journey, where he built a shelter to wait for them, as there was frost everywhere.

Despite the cold, the three young men gritted their teeth and took the climb. There they were attacked by a Wolf of Fosh, a huge frozen predator, who was a servant of [[Varushka]]. They found her a little later, but as much as she wanted to, she couldn't immediately take revenge on them for their act. But he could with the power from the Norns curse them, and that she did. Her prophecy said that of the three brothers, the first would be hated by everyone, the second would go mad, and the third would die young.

Disregarding the crazy hag as they saw her, the brothers continued on their mission. They fought their way through many trolls that [[Balgrimm]] had placed in wait in the frozen passage, as well as various other creatures of the ice. They climbed up an icy waterfall to his lair and began to fight him. [[Pineg]] struck him with his axe, [[Maul]] with his iron fists, and [[Hramm]] with a fine sword. But Balgrimm understood that they had tired to reach him and that he had the advantage. His injuries were not serious. With his club he melted [[Hramm]] into the rocks, fulfilling the first part of the hag's prophecy. [[Maul]] fell unconscious covered in bruises, and [[Pineg]] soon followed as his ax blunted.

The two surviving brothers awoke bound upside down, covered in wounds and frostbite, next to the sleeping troll. He had already eaten Hramm's leg and seemed to be setting them up for a future meal. Maybe the prophecy kept them from dying, maybe they were just too stubborn. They found knives among the belongings of Balgrimm's victims and cut their bonds. They attacked the troll with fury, and stabbed him in the neck and head that was left, and this time he was dead forever.

And then the size of the hag's curse became imminent. Maul's judgement became clouded and had a headache, while Pineg, paranoid, believed his brother wanted to betray him and go off on his own. The two brothers came to blows, and Maul emerged victorious. He left Pineg for dead, took all the loot in the cave along with the head, and returned to the waiting Koldrag. When asked where his brothers were, he replied that they were killed by trolls. They took the long way back to the tribe, with Maul already feeling like a leader within him.

When he returned alone to the tribe with [[Grimson]]'s legendary skull on his frostbitten hand, he assumed leadership of the tribe and [[Elder Gorhald]] stepped aside.
