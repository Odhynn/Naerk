A dwarf that travelled south to [[Hasnev]] to find his fortune. He ended up in Marleon arena, where he is believed to be the longest surviving gladiator. He saved [[Ternath]] from the arena with the price of his freedom. In truth, however, hew grew over the years accustomed to arena life and the glory and he declined several chances to get out.
