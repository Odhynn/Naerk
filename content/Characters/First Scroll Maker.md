Spell scrolls have been found in various places in [[Naerk]], with early forms of very common spells inscribed on them. This would not be remarkable if one did not consider that these scrolls are at least three thousand years old. According to [[Arothal]] and any other expert magician who has had the opportunity to study them, they come from the same author. Specifically:

-Detect Magic was found in what is now [[Oromil]].
-Create Water was found in the [[Allwick]] Desert.
-Shield was found in [[Hoss Glacier]].
-Magic Missile was found in the [[Blackwoods]].
-Animate Dead was found in what is now [[South Darrok]].
-Magic Aura was found in [[Zelgerosh]].
-Arcane Mark was found in [[Edhelwood]].
-Sleep was found on [[Walrus Shores]] of [[Belgosreim]].
-Another unknown scroll was found in what is now [[Northern Darrok]].

As we do not know whether this is a real person or not, references to it are made through the pseudonym "The First Scroll Maker".

The last scroll contains a spell related to the flow of time, but no one who has researched it has been able to make it work or determine exactly what this spell does. Opinions differ as to why this is the case. Many say that this is an incomplete or failed spell, while the prevailing theory supported by Arothal is that it was created at a time when magic worked differently and could support this spell.
