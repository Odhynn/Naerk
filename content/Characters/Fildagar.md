## Story

An ancient guardian of a [[Solarium Rings|Solarium Ring]], Fildagar was famous and respected in all [[Oromil]]. Before his death of old age, he gave the ring to [[Akerosoth]] and made her swear that she would protect it and uphold [[Dragonpact]]. 

## Legacy

His lair was on the top of the South Watchers, at over 20000 ft altitude, and guarded by frost salamanders and other frost elementals. It included a library and several magical items, along with the ring, which were passed over to the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]].
