> _"If that cures us, you have my word that I will call a truce. We will hold the first level and stop having visions for further areas in the city." He looked at the others around him, as if they were waiting for him to say something. "But if" and his eyes became the narrow slits of a predator "you fool us and this here doesn't work, then you have my word that there is no place you will feel safe in your life, no matter how much magic you do. You will be permanently hunted."_

A [[Silvertail]] leader of the werewolves that joined the [[Werewolf Siege]] in [[Tas-Roch]]. A strong and very fast werewolf with silver fur and a keen tracker. During the siege, he tried to keep the unity among the ranks of his kin and stop the riots between werewolves. When [[Angariel]] proposed that she would make a potion to cure them and help them control their shape, they accepted and Taurlin trusted her, but warned her that she would face his wrath if she was lying. 

Taurlin was among the few, if not the only one that the potion helped. His kin was devastated, with some growing mad, some permanent staying in animal or hybrid form and during the outbreak he realised the witch betrayed his trust. As he vowed, he hunted her as she fled to the north, but first he gave his newborn [[Tukai|son]] to [[Targos]], a nomad from [[Rammok Wastes]]. He travelled to [[Oventhart]] and tried to help werewolves that faced the same problem in [[Melinor]].

He was able to find the witch near the Blackwoods two years later. After a long hunt in the woods, he was the only survivor of her traps when he found her scent. He chased her down, pounced on her and butchered her with bites and claws until she was a bloody pile of meat. He cut off her head and sent it to [[Tas-Roch]], where it was magically preserved to adorn the walls, by popular demand.
