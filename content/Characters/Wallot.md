Influential member of [[Crimson Steel]]
Killer of [[Torris]] Lionhead
Master Assassin

During the [[War of Arbader and South Darrok]], he led a scouting team of [[Crimson Steel]] in [[Qweenswood]] and stole the legendary helmet [[Kalvathron]] that he gave to [[King Laorwick I]].

The next year of the war, he attacked general [[Torris]] Lionhead with an assassin team one night and used a large crossbow that was next to his dragon [[Stenthix]] to kill him on the spot. Taken by surprise, Torris awoke and fought his assassins valiantly with only a few guards by his side. He laid down several dead, but he too eventually fell when Wallot's scythe stabbed him in the back, the point of which pierced his armor. When the blade touched him, he turned pale and within an instant he was dead.
