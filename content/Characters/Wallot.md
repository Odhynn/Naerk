Influential member of [[Crimson Steel]]
Killer of [[Torris]] Lionhead
Master Assassin

## Description

One of the [[Crimson Steel]] Four, Wallot has his own agenda, his own people, and his own exploits. He is considered the most effective assassin to ever set foot in [[Arbader]], and it is no coincidence that he has the greatest numerical superiority within the organization. No one really knows who he is, but his name is enough to sow fear and awe in the country's underworld. It is believed that he is playing a game of chess against the [[Order of the Cave]] and [[Lady of Pain]] personally.

## History

During the [[War of Arbader and South Darrok]], he led a scouting team of [[Crimson Steel]] in [[Qweenswood]] and stole the legendary helmet [[Kalvathron]] that he gave to [[King Laorwick I]].

The next year of the war, he attacked general [[Torris]] Lionhead with an assassin team one night and used a large crossbow that was next to his dragon [[Stenthix]] to kill him on the spot. Taken by surprise, Torris awoke and fought his assassins valiantly with only a few guards by his side. He laid down several dead, but he too eventually fell when Wallot's scythe stabbed him in the back, the point of which pierced his armor. When the blade touched him, he turned pale and within an instant he was dead.

In the second half of the 48th century he settled for several decades in [[Hasnev]]. He was involved in several murders and illegal activities, until the events of [[Hashnev, Revolt and Betrayal]] and the death of several of his agents forced him out of the city.
