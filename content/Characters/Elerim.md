A sorcerer of the [[Twilight Veil]] and student of the wizard [[Flagwar]]. He despised [[Ulsath]] but made efforts to understand and accept her when he understood that she shared a common goal with his teacher. He was deeply suddened by [[Flagwar]]'s passing but carried on his duties in the cave.

He practiced summoning rituals and in one occasion called a shining extraplanar creature.
