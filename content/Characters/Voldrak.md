A nomad cleric of [[Karadosh]], Voldrak became associates with [[Gathclan Tulenkar]] after the second proposed him an advantageous deal to end the nomad hostilities. The deal had a financial profit for both and Voldrak eventually settled in [[Fellgaunt]] and helped the Tulenkar in [[Battle of Fellgaunt]]. He was at the brink of death when rumors say that he and [[Domosan]] were summoned to the Keep of [[Karadosh]] at [[Tartara]] and were given a second chance at life to promote his warbringer agenda. They slaughtered many Kalistrom and undead foes in His name that day.

After the battle, he became the leader of Gheren Steed as the most devoted cleric of Karadosh. He took his army and broke the deal with Tulenkar for unknown reasons, and started raiding caravans in the plains. It was later revealed that he asked Gathclan for the hand of his daughter, [[Beyin Tulenkar|Beyin]], but she was already betrothed to captain [[Geraldor]]. Voldrak fought several skirmishes against the captain but died by treachery of his own warriors. He was found murdered on his own tent.
