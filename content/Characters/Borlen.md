A famous runesmith in [[Hlafengrond]] and father of [[Jarl Yuradal]].

The son of the legendary [[Olaff]] trollslayer, his father tried to teach her the harsh life of being a [[Hurtvigsen]] with extreme endurance tests. He escaped as a child the southeners' attack at [[Elestair]] with his sister, [[Gyrtrud]] and sought refuge at the [[Hooks]]. Afterwards, he embarked on the ship of the pirate captain [[Jason]] Gollan. After three difficult years of living with the pirates, they were targeted by a dire prophecy and attacked by wraiths. They tried to defend themselves, but he lost his leg in the fight and she went half-blind.

Returning to [[Zolkar]] as a cripple, he found work as a smith and eventually he perfected his craft. He tried to find her sister as she went missing, to no avail. Four years later he returned to the north, only to find [[Kalenvad]] in dissaray. He became well-known for his craft and there he got married [[Yulla]] and fathered [[Jarl Yuradal|Yuradal]].
