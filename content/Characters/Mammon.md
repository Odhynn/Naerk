Lord Mammon is the ruler of Galthar, the 8th layer of [[Hell]], who is a hypertrophic devil, scribe and bureaucrat. Most of the other lords tend to look down on him, but despite his apparent indolence he has enormous power and political authority in his hands, as all of Hell's currency and transactions pass through his hands, directly or indirectly.
