A witted halfling that had the reputation of being an accomplished Giant Killer. He fought at [[War of the Titan]] and killed several stone giants, including a huge four armed behemoth, while defending the outskirts of [[Ekteron]]. He was crushed under a huge boulder thrown by [[Bord]], the leader of stone giants.
