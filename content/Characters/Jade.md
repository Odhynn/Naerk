A witted halfling that had the reputation of being an accomplished Giant Killer during the [[Decade War of Arbader and South Darrok]]. He was furious of the assassination of the beloved general [[Torris]] Lionhead and took it upon himself to avenge him. He led a shipborne attack on [[Llykavann]] to break the siege of Reynald's tower. With a select group of sixty veterans, they arrived at the harbor in five schooners and fell upon the cyclops garrison that Laorwick had placed there. They attacked by surprise and managed to kill or scatter most of them, and in the confusion they entered the tower and resupplied the garrison of the governor [[Reynald]].

The cyclops attempted to organize a defense while the veterans unloaded food from the schooners, but Jade would not let them. Every time someone tried to give orders, he was surrounded by ten experienced warriors, while Jade delivered the finishing blow. This was repeated fourteen times, with Jade that day earning the nickname Giantkiller, as he killed the cyclops with his pickaxe one after another. Then, after the schooners were emptied, the servants and wounded who had remained in the tower were evacuated, and only two hundred remained there, the rest fleeing by sea. Jade remained in the tower to defend the governor. It was one of the most humiliating defeats of [[King Laorwick I]].



At a very old age, he fought at [[War of the Titan]] and killed several stone giants, including a huge four armed behemoth, while defending the outskirts of [[Ekteron]]. He was crushed under a huge boulder thrown by [[Bord]], the leader of stone giants.
