A winged deceiver demon that arrived in [[Olgizmar]] shortly after the [[Pyrlon Carnage]] through the Gate. He shortly joined the [[Vile Septet]] and ruled [[Pyrlon]] with [[Mir'girra]]. During the [[Bloodline War]], he was sent in [[Lamerpad]]'s war council as a spy, taking the form of [[Olken]], a diseased emissary. He conveyed critical information about the counterattack plans on the [[Vile Septet]] and when it took place they were ready.

When a second emissary arrived in [[Lamerpad]]'s keep, it was imminent that his cover was blown. Ildish tried to grab him but Molroth dodged him and started flying towards [[Olgizmar]]. The general summoned a pegasi and began chasing him through the air, when an arrow from [[Kandir]] struck him in the leg and knocked him off balance. Ildish's sword finished him off with a lightning strike.

However, the damage was already done: The expeditionary force was walking into a trap from which it was impossible to escape. All because of the critical information he delivered.
