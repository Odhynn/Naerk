The general and military leader that accompanied the baron [[Qurin]] during the [[First Zelgerosh Exploration]]. He was very aggresive towards the local [[Tixali]] people and attacked them initially when they reached Itza, but other members of the expedition stepped in and intervened to stop the bloodshed. Duarte insisted they should explore the interior, but Qurin did not want to break the informal peace with the rest of the [[Tixali]] tribes. They established a second coastal base east of the [[Sumshirlu]] swamps, which became General Duarte's headquarters.

He expelled [[Qurin]] from the city when he returned, and cut all ties with [[Imtaria]]. He turned to piracy, looting official ships and convoys, while his outpost soon became the infamous [[Plunder Town]].
