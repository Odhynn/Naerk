An half-mad archpriest of [[Amehan]]. Wherever he went, doom followed. He was recruited by [[Dumspergrond]] to wake up a colossus sleeping in the mountains of [[Tarhelm]] and bind him to his will. For this task, he was given ten powerful Death Giants. He was stopped and killed by the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]].
