The couple had many children but all of them died within a week after birth. Ireno and his wife sought many angels and even demons to help them, but always the answer was _“there is nothing even I can do.”_ But they did not give up. One day Ireno’s wife had heard of this great angel called Chun’m and they decided to plea to him, too. She knew she did not have much time left and she had grown desperate to see a child between them live to stay with Ireno.

[[Chun’m]], too, knew he could not help the couple very much. But so wide and broad was his heart that he blessed them nonetheless. He decreed that their next child will live long and bring beautiful music to the world. Perhaps because of this, Ireno’s next child lived to be eight days old. At this moment, the spiteful Witch noticed something was wrong and looked at Ireno’s star, saying _“well, you get to keep one thing and one thing only, but don’t you think I will allow you happiness.”_

So Ireno’s wife died.
