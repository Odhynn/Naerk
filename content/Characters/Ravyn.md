An explorer and a chartographer from [[Syvorms Chartographic Society]]. He followed baron [[Qurin]] in the [[First Zelgerosh Exploration]]. Later, he tried to reach the inner jungles of [[Zelgerosh]] and find the famous [[City of the Sun God]]. He assembled a small group and ventured forth, but his tracks were lost in the jungle.

His tragic story was later known to public when a hunter from [[Itza]] found [[Halgonia's diary]] in the jungle with their adventures.
