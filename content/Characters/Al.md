## Origin

Al, like many other great wizards, was an extremely intelligent and talented individual. He had such talent and passion for the study of [[Veth]]'s radiation that he took his first steps in teaching magic at the age of 16 and was recognized early on as a very capable teacher. His real passion was the study of the way Veth radiation behaves and the way it changes with the use of specific spells, as well as the lasting effects on it. With his work, he has greatly advanced the use of clairvoyant magic. That is where he got the nickname Clairvoyant, which if you ask him himself, he will tell you that: "the ability to understand what spells have been cast through reading the radiation they leave has nothing to do with clairvoyance." He was missing and has not been heard from for at least two decades. Many elves said he died due to the sensitivity humans have to the passage of time, while others said his research drove him mad and that he was locked away in a magical laboratory or that he travels to other dimensions to explore the differences of magic in them. In reality, however, he had left his book of spells and secrets locked away somewhere behind and lived a seemingly simple and austere life in northern [[Oventhart]], waiting for his time on the planet to end. And that time soon came with the opening of the [[Wells of Power]].

## End of [[Feneg]] and [[Feren]]

Al with the help of [[Angasar]] and [[Oliven]] performed a ceremony on the southern border of dragon [[Feneg]]'s territory, awakening the ancient dragon [[Feren]] â€” who until then everyone thought that he has traveled to another, unknown region - from his long sleep. A fierce and chaotic battle broke out. [[Oliven]] took on the mighty Feren who was stronger and angrier than ever, Angasar fought his firstborn son [[Feneg]] and [[Al]] along with an alchemist, an orc blacksmith, a priest and three guards kept his sister [[Faeg]] at a safe distance to not interfere with the ceremony. Angasar managed to kill Feneg using the help of trees and forest animals. Oliven unleashed a series of powerful lightning bolts that struck and seared the beast and with another lightning bolt at Faeg he knocked the two dragons to the floor, never to rise again.
