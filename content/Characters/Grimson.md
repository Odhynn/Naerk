## Origins

Believed to be the first orc of the Broken Skull tribe and a brave traveler. He was not afraid of snow and mountains, and he traveled to the farthest parts of the north in search of a better land for his people, [[Dal'Vorag]]. His efforts led them deep into [[Fervolosh]], where they claimed a territory inhabited by beautiful unicorns. Grimson ordered to hunted them down and drive them away. This act of his displeased many forest creatures and neighbors, who periodically began to launch raids, wanting Grimson dead.

When he realized he was the focus of these attacks, he decided to exile himself to protect his kin. He packed his things and continued his travels north, hoping that he left his tribe in a good fate. He made his way to the [[Legthir Pass]], but the [[Norns]] of the North learned of his presence there and sent their daughter [[Varushka]] to avenge him for his deeds in the forest. She found a two-headed ice troll, [[Balbar]], and promised him untold power if he killed Grimson.

## Revenge of the Norns

On the way to the snow-covered pass, Balbar orchestrated his ambush. He brought his own warriors who began to throw nets and spears at the orc. But Grimson was an experienced hunter. He dodged the projectiles and jumped onto the rocks, and with his sword began to cut down the trolls one by one. Balbar's minions could not stop him, and Grimson reached their leader. They began to sword fight, but Grimson was much faster. Balbar's body was riddled with gashes, and soon the exiled orc found an opening and cut off his first head. Varushka, seeing that the battle was not going well, cursed Grimson with a spell above that was about to finish off the troll, blinding him. Balbar, seeing him confused, seized him by the leg and dashed him against the rocks, breaking his head.

Varushka kept her promise and empowered Balbar. He took the orc's broken head, necromantically fitted it to the troll's severed neck and the second head from Bar was renamed Grimm: Balgrimm. The troll drew power from his enemy's skull, and renewed his powers with the help of the witch, who settled nearby and gave him ice golems to guard him and immortality for his success.

News of Grimson's fate reached the tribe and they thought it was a great disgrace that no one helped him. It was then that they also took the name of the Broken Skull, [[Dal'Vorag]]. They organized a group of warriors to go and bring back his head, but with [[Balgrimm]]'s enhanced forces, the few who arrived unharmed from the cold were slaughtered on the frozen stones of [[Legthir Pass]]. Since then, the Dal'Vorag clan mounted numerous quests over the following decades to retrieve the skull and avenge the troll, but they failed.

## Legacy

Gradually the story became a myth, and the dead warriors there simply the subject of stories around the fire. Until, many years later, an orc prophet told the leader, [[Elder Gorhald]] Baragon, that whoever brought the skull back to the tribe would become its greatest leader. Gorhald didn't care about the prophecy, since he was already a leader and had nothing to prove to anyone. But the time came when his sons, Pineg, Maul and Hramm grew up and began to claim the leadership, while they began to become jealous and hostile among themselves.

One night, Gorhald called them to his tent. He told them the story of Grimson, and that whoever brought him the skull would become chief of the clan in his place. The three brothers lost no opportunity to prove their worth and take office, and next morning they prepared to leave for the Legthir Pass. Koldrag, a distant descendant of Grimson, led them to the pass after a long journey, where he built a shelter to wait for them, as there was frost everywhere.

Despite the cold, the three young men gritted their teeth and took the climb. There they were attacked by a Wolf of Fosh, a huge frozen predator, who was a servant of Varushka. They found her a little later, but as much as she wanted to, she couldn't immediately take revenge on them for their act. But he could with the power from the Norns curse them, and he did. Her prophecy said that of the three brothers, the first would be hated by everyone, the second would go mad, and the third would die young.
