## Origins

Believed to be the first orc of the Broken Skull tribe and a brave traveler. He was not afraid of snow and mountains, and he traveled to the farthest parts of the north in search of a better land for his people, [[Dal'Vorag]]. His efforts led them deep into [[Fervolosh]], where they claimed a territory inhabited by beautiful unicorns. Grimson ordered to hunted them down and drive them away. This act of his displeased many forest creatures and neighbors, who periodically began to launch raids, wanting Grimson dead.

When he realized he was the focus of these attacks, he decided to exile himself to protect his kin. He packed his things and continued his travels north, hoping that he left his tribe in a good fate. He made his way to the [[Legthir Pass]], but the [[Norns]] of the North learned of his presence there and sent their daughter [[Varushka]] to avenge him for his deeds in the forest. She found a two-headed ice troll, [[Balbar]], and promised him untold power if he killed Grimson.

## Revenge of the Norns

On the way to the snow-covered pass, Balbar orchestrated his ambush. He brought his own warriors who began to throw nets and spears at the orc. But Grimson was an experienced hunter. He dodged the projectiles and jumped onto the rocks, and with his sword began to cut down the trolls one by one. Balbar's minions could not stop him, and Grimson reached their leader. They began to sword fight, but Grimson was much faster. Balbar's body was riddled with gashes, and soon the exiled orc found an opening and cut off his first head. Varushka, seeing that the battle was not going well, cursed Grimson with a spell above that was about to finish off the troll, blinding him. Balbar, seeing him confused, seized him by the leg and dashed him against the rocks, breaking his head.

Varushka kept her promise and empowered Balbar. He took the orc's broken head, necromantically fitted it to the troll's severed neck and the second head from Bar was renamed Grimm: Balgrimm. The troll drew power from his enemy's skull, and renewed his powers with the help of the witch, who settled nearby and gave him ice golems to guard him and immortality for his success.

News of Grimson's fate reached the tribe and they thought it was a great disgrace that no one helped him. It was then that they also took the name of the Broken Skull, [[Dal'Vorag]]. They organized a group of warriors to go and bring back his head, but with [[Balgrimm]]'s enhanced forces, the few who arrived unharmed from the cold were slaughtered on the frozen stones of [[Legthir Pass]]. Since then, the Dal'Vorag clan mounted numerous quests over the following decades to retrieve the skull and avenge the troll, but they failed.

## Legacy

Gradually the story became a myth, and the dead warriors there simply the subject of stories around the fire. Until, many years later, an orc prophet told the leader, [[Elder Gorhald]] Baragon, that whoever brought the skull back to the tribe would become its greatest leader. Gorhald didn't care about the prophecy, since he was already a leader and had nothing to prove to anyone. But the time came when his sons, [[Pineg]], [[Maul]] and [[Hramm]] grew up and began to claim the leadership, while they began to become jealous and hostile among themselves.

One night, Gorhald called them to his tent. He told them the story of [[Grimson]], and that whoever brought him the skull would become chief of the clan in his place. The three brothers lost no opportunity to prove their worth and take command of the tribe, and next morning they prepared to leave for [[Legthir Pass]]. [[Koldrag]], a distant descendant of Grimson, led them to the pass after a long journey, where he built a shelter to wait for them, as there was frost everywhere.

Despite the cold, the three young men gritted their teeth and took the climb. There they were attacked by a Wolf of Fosh, a huge frozen predator, who was a servant of [[Varushka]]. They found her a little later, but as much as she wanted to, she couldn't immediately take revenge on them for their act. But he could with the power from the Norns curse them, and that she did. Her prophecy said that of the three brothers, the first would be hated by everyone, the second would go mad, and the third would die young.

Disregarding the crazy hag as they saw her, the brothers continued on their mission. They fought their way through many trolls that [[Balgrimm]] had placed in wait in the frozen passage, as well as various other creatures of the ice. They climbed up an icy waterfall to his lair and began to fight him. [[Pineg]] struck him with his axe, [[Maul]] with his iron fists, and [[Hramm]] with a fine sword. But Balgrimm understood that they had tired to reach him and that he had the advantage. His injuries were not serious. With his club he melted [[Hramm]] into the rocks, fulfilling the first part of the hag's prophecy. [[Maul]] fell unconscious covered in bruises, and [[Pineg]] soon followed as his ax blunted.

The two surviving brothers awoke bound upside down, covered in wounds and frostbite, next to the sleeping troll. He had already eaten Hramm's leg and seemed to be setting them up for a future meal. Maybe the prophecy kept them from dying, maybe they were just too stubborn. They found knives among the belongings of Balgrimm's victims and cut their bonds. They attacked the troll with fury, and stabbed him in the neck and head that was left, and this time he was dead forever.

And then the size of the hag's curse became imminent. Maul's judgement became clouded and had a headache, while Pineg, paranoid, believed his brother wanted to betray him and go off on his own. The two brothers came to blows, and Maul emerged victorious. He left Pineg for dead, took all the loot in the cave along with the head, and returned to the waiting Koldrag. When asked where his brothers were, he replied that they were killed by trolls. They took the long way back to the tribe, with Maul already feeling like a leader within him.

Pineg regained consciousness much later. He had lost half his fingers to frostbite and was in a miserable condition. He dragged his dagger towards the nearest being who could help him, who was none other than the witch. Varushka, happy to be in complete control of the situation, found that Pineg could be of use to her. She sent him to distant [[Fol'rish]], Hoss's frozen palace, to bring her [[Ylamir]]'s corpse in exchange for Maul's death. Pineg had no choice but to nod.

After a difficult journey there and back, he managed with much difficulty to accomplish the task. He had changed completely: his face had become determined, and his skin had hardened and turned pink from the cold. He was able to pry [[Ylamir]]'s corpse from his heart, which was bound to the palace, and brought it to the witch. She created an undead from the corpse, merging Ylamir's soul with that of the dead [[Hramm]], and revealed to Pineg her true plan. The new Hramm would kill Pineg and take over the leadership, allowing her to directly control the Dal'Vorag clan.

Pineg tried to fight back, and Varushka invoked a spell to kill him, as he was now useless to her. But then the [[Norns]] intervened: their daughter had far exceeded her role. He tried to kill Maul before his time, and resurrected Hramm when he was supposed to die. And for this life, the price would be the highest: Her life itself. Drokasner produced a sudden bolt of lightning, which fell violently upon her, charring her in an instant. Silent and vindicated, Pineg gathered up what he found useful there and started down the frozen passage to turn south. His gaze flashed, unpredictable and fierce, while the undead Hramm followed silently behind him.

After all, Maul brought Grimson's skull to the tribe and assumed leadership, with his father stepping aside.
