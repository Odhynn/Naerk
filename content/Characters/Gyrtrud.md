The daughter of the legendary [[Olaff]] trollslayer. Her father tried to teach her the harsh life of being a [[Hurtvigsen]]. She escaped as a child the southeners' attack at [[Elestair]] with her brother, [[Borlen]] and sought refuge at the [[Hooks]]. Afterwards, she embarked on the ship of the pirate captain [[Jason]] Gollan. After three difficult years of living with the pirates, they were targeted by a dire prophecy and attacked by wraiths. They tried to defend themselves, but she went half-blind and [[Borlen]] lost his leg in the fight.

She wandered wearing a mask to foreign lands, leaving her brother as an apprentice to a smith. Her tracks are lost since.
