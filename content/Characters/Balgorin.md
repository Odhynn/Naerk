## Origin

A renowned hunter and tracker, Balgorin by the age of forty was by far the best marksman in the whole city of [[Qumbar]]. He wielded a unique repeating crossbow, and many believed he could hold a castle by himself. He lived a lonely life, in the north of the city, while he was often away hunting.

Balgorin inspired great confidence in Qumbar, and had trained many crossbowmen to fight the coming threat of [[Kambah]]. Of course, he himself did not want to take any administrative position, even though he had been offered it repeatedly by the city officials that respected his abilities. He preferred his peace and his family: He was taciturn and did not want to be in the limelight.

## [[Fall of Qumbar]]

During the [[Fall of Qumbar]] at the start of the [[War of Karahath]], he discovered the huge enemy forces and was overwhelmed by the sheer size of it. He decided to betray his own kin. He led the [[Kenorex]] forces towards the side entrance of the city. In the dark, it wasn't hard to mistake him for their own tracker. There was a very tall tree that had been struck by lightning and withered. He yelled at them to chip it so it would fall on the gate. By the time they did, he himself climbed up with a rope and began killing all the defenders on the walls. The picture was horrifying: In the confusion, it took the defenders a long time to understand what was happening, and even when they did, they were overcome with panic at the mere thought that [[Balgorin]], their best archer, had betrayed them.

On the walls, Balgorin shot arrows at anyone who moved. Soon, the tree fell and one by one, the Kenorex climbed the walls. He led them to the central square of the village, where the massacre began. The orcs started killing any locals who passed by, even civilians. Balgorin then realized, from their cries, that rumors of his betrayal had spread. He decided that these rumors had to be put to rest once and for all, or he would find himself in trouble from [[Oventhart]]. At the same time he wanted to make [[Kenorex]] trust him. He began to snipe all the officials in sight, and led the army into shelters and into the temples of the city. He showed no respect: He killed pregnant women, young children and old men. His face was a cold and expressionless mask.

Qumbar fell within three hours, and because of Balgorin's treachery it meant that the attack from both gates left no escape route for the inhabitants. The carnage took on colossal proportions and those who survived were few. The Kenorex trusted the traitor effortlessly. Balgorin became a captain in the city, responsible for maintaining order, while the Kenorex developed their forces to advance their advance on [[Unariel]] and [[Nador]].

## Aftermath

No one is ultimately sure what led to Balgorin's betrayal and his motives. The only thing that is certain is that because of him the Kenorex gained at least two days of advance, while his name, despite his efforts, became so hated in Oventhart that it is said that they even turned to [[Crimson Steel]] to take him down. Balgorin was eventually killed shortly before the [[Battle of Qumbar|battle to retake Qumbar]] from Oventhart's army. His face was burned, while he had arrows in his back. No one found out who killed him.
