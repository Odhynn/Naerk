A famous bard that inspired courage in the ranks of the warriors. His presence in the [[War of the Titan]] was crucial for keeping the morale against the overwhelming forces of the giants. He was critically injured by the cave troll [[Zlo'ttan]] and was escorted to safety by the heroic effords of his men. After the city was saved, he was elected the new king and ruled fair thereafter.

He is the great-great grandson of the hero and general [[Torris]] Lionhead.
