A steadfast lady of [[Hlafengrond]] that is said to keep the [[Kalenvad]] tribe from ruin for a decade after [[Jarl Forjod]] was captured by the southeners in [[Elestair]]. She married [[Borlen]] and gave birth to the future [[Jarl Yuradal]], whom she taught how to rule and make important decisions.
