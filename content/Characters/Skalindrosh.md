Son of [[King Thogodram]]
Archpriest of [[Drokasner]]

During the [[War of the Titan]], [[Dumspergrond]] appointed him his general. He destroyed the village of [[Northwind]], leaving [[Krellantre]] behind to defend it and fought on against the army mustered by general [[Ildish]]. His force killed thousands of human and elven soldiers, but eventually their own casualties were huge and he was forced to retreat.
