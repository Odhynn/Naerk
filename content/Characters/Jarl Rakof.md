The old ex-jarl of [[Fosh]] and father of current [[Jarlskona Lengosha]]. He became friends with the giant scribe [[Dalvuigg]] as he valued his wisdom highly. He even trusted him his daughter. After the frost giants attacked at the [[Battle of Norleg Cross]], and [[Dalvuigg]] dueled [[Gert]] to protect them, their friendship was revived and he accepted giants as tribute for warriors, bodyguards and workers.
