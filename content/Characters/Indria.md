A respected champion and guardian of the [[Temple of the Sapphire Guard]] that channeled powerful energy from [[Utopia]] into her armaments. The thief [[Saskath]] stole a [[Solarium Rings|Solarium Ring]] from the temple during her watch, so she took it upon herself to hunt him and bring him to justice. During her travels, she was tricked by an assassin, [[Sindariel]], into falling to [[Styx]]. This journey broke her resolve and her spirit and she returned confused and full of doubts. She was killed by [[Saskath]].
