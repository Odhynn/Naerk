## History

Arsinoe was born in a family of gnome members of [[Wyrmsfall]] with a strong tradition in illusion magic. She had begun to train and study magic almost since she was born. Although her talent for magic began to show from an early age, it was not enough to impress her parents, since as they said "our whole race could do this and so much more at your age". Somehow, Arsinoe's entire childhood ended up in an endless race to prove her talent to her parents with countless hours of reading and practicing.

The years passed, the range of her abilities increased and every day fewer and fewer things were impossible to her. Her parents, however, still were not satisfied with her mastery of magic, until one day the perfect opportunity came. A letter arrived at her parents' door, the Wyrmfall had to take action. A young black dragon, disrespecting the [[Dragonpact]], burned three villages to make his territory. The Wyrmsfall and the Pact Keepers would meet at the next full moon to begin the hunt. This was her chance, she just had to find the dragon herself by the next full moon and kill him. After all, he was only a few centuries old: his powers wouldn't be great yet and when she wasn't studying magic, she was studying how to fight dragons (a subject that didn't interest her at all though).

Arsinoe sneaked out of the house and began the search, which proved to be extremely difficult. A few days later her divination spells found the dragon and the battle between the two began. It was more a battle of cunning than strength and was much more difficult and dangerous than Arsinoe imagined, but in the end, bluff after bluff, she was able to lead the dragon into a powerful trap she had set earlier. When it was activated, the dragon believed a fake spear that was launched at its eye and it became real, piercing it. Thus she emerged the winner of this deadly duel.

When she returned to her parents, the meeting was not as she had expected. Instead of them congratulating her and recognizing her potential, they did not show the slightest trace of pleasure, almost indifferent. Her father told her _"Go and rest now, you have a lot of studying tomorrow."_ She had been thinking about this phrase for months, and every time she failed at anything, her father's voice in her head would repeat the exact same words.

In the following weeks, a slightly larger black dragon came to the former's territory, arguing that the villages had already been burned, so the area could be contested to his claim, since there were no other human civilizations nearby. The Pact Keepers asked for a few months to decide what the appropriate management would be, but the [[Wyrmsfall]] were clearly annoyed that the dragon's stay was under discussion. One day, Arsinoe's parents went with other Wyrmsfall to ask the dragon to leave the area until a decision was made. It is not known exactly what happened that day or who started it, but a fierce battle broke out between the Wyrmsfall and the dragon, which led to the death of all the Wyrmsfall who were there. After these events, the Dragonpact decided to expel the dragon from the area.

Arsinoe's story is very hazy after this point and for the next century. Most accounts have her going to [[Utopia]] in search of inner peace, but nothing is confirmed until her arrival in [[Reisdok]]. It was during this time that she created the prismatic armor spell, upgrading the Wyrmsfall's chromatic armor, and this is the last thing that connects her to the Wyrmsfall. She had nothing left to prove, and this made her more powerful than ever. She no longer wanted to be recognized for her powers, which led her into constantly hiding behind disguises and becoming so good that no one even remembered her race anymore.

## [[Thyllinar]] and Cornuzel

No one could claim to be better than her at magic, except perhaps the most powerful wizard in the city, [[Thyllinar]] "Dreamvale" Aelvorii, who was rumored to be able to make your dreams your worst enemy. A clash between the two seemed inevitable. 
Until one day a voice from behind her exclaimed:
-_"Gnome, eh? I can't say I'm surprised."_
-_"You couldn't have approached me without me noticing, nor could you have been tracking me from a distance with magic without my security measures blocking you. That means you only approached me in an extension of our existence outside the [[Material Plane]]. Only one scenario is logical: you are [[Thyllinar]] and I am dreaming."_
-_"Congratulations, I've never heard anyone catch on so quickly!"_
-_"Thanks, but what are you doing here?_"
-_"I was intrigued by the stories of a new presence in town who might be as good with magic as I am, and I came to meet you."_

The two of them married and founded the powerful [[Cornuzel]] magic academy. The Cornuzel archwizard councils are held in Thyllinar's castle in [[Dreamworld]], the safest place they knew. As a sign of respect, everyone speaks in whispers or telepathically, so as not to disturb the sleeping fireflies around. Soon, the Cornuzel became friendly with the Twalar, and several agreed to help them in their battles against [[Voolthow]].
