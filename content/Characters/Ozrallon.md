A bad-tempered sea dragon and son of [[Alfavriix]]. He fought in [[The Blaburry Expansion]] and killed many fey. After his mothers death, he took refuge in a cave near the northern shores, where a decisive part of the battle took place. He hunted down those who remained and made the ruins of the temple his home, while imprisoning [[Queen Valauri]] and as many fey as he could capture. No one dared to go into the cave to save the queen, except the traitor fey Flux, who was helpless.

Many decades after, in 4818, a group of travelers, including [[Bjonnyr]] found Ozrallon's lair. Once Flux told them what happened, they attacked the lizardmen, freed Valauri, and with her help killed Ozrallon and took [[Tikimura]] to the Evergrowing Forest for her final resting place. The temple was destroyed and Valauri restored the nature to the area and forgave [[Flux]] for his betrayal.
