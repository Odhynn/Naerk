**1st Admiral Naroth Geadan**
Chief Admiral of [[Palaurim]] Navy
Archpriest of [[Hydarax]]
Prince of [[Urdankh]]
Father of [[Deator Geadan]]

He survived [[Battle of Misty Sea]], after he managed to escape [[Rongerak]]'s treachery and form a defence with his spells and commands to salvage part of the fleet. After the Battle, he wasn't ready to lay down his arms. He wanted to take action, and he had many ideas in mind. However, he knew in his heart that he would take on his duties with much more joy if he saw the values of justice and peace, which defined him and his own country, represented in the faces and decisions of the high officials and the emperor. Instead, he saw greed, laziness and indifference. And he knew that this alone could bring disaster. 

He was cut off with the rest of his navy and sought shelter to the rocky northern shores where he found accidentaly [[Ulsath|a witch]]. They agreed to help each other, with her hiding him from the pursuing [[Kambah]] fleet and him helping her to subdue a white dragon and steal his lair. Afterwards, they traveled south to [[Hashnev]], where a council of [[Palaurim]] was taking place. Till then, most generals believed him to be dead in the battle.
