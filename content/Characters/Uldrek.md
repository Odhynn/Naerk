_"The four will be random, but we can't do anything about it. Whoever exploits them for his own benefit, let the gods punish him swiftly."_

The taciturn leader of the [[Skra]] tribe and a respected elder amongst his people. From time to time he has conflicting views for the future of the tribe with [[Meegar]] Lurok. He declared the lake [[Furbung]] sacred. He lost his nephew at the [[First Battle of Kiribung]].
