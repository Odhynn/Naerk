A beautiful, but hot-tempered and rude [[Crel]] witch and the second daughter of [[Jarl Olof]]. Her hand was pledged to [[Granit]] if he could draw away the [[Kenorex]] threat from their lands. On his [[The Saga of Granit, The Bastard of the North|success]], everyone was talking about his courage and daring, and Olof could not help but give up his prize. Frigg, however, would not accept him. At their wedding feast she gave him a potion that made people boundless and arrogant. She hoped that this would magnify Granit's worst traits and create a scandal big enough to dissolve their marriage.

The young hero indeed showed his worst self, drunk on glory and his constant successful tricks. He began to boast about his exploits, some very inflated and most unheard of. The worst came when, because of the potion, he swore by the [[Aspects]] as witnesses that what he had said was true, something that would follow him for the rest of his life. Later, the Aspects called them in the [[Evergrowing Forest]] as they were deeply insulted by the behaviour of both.
