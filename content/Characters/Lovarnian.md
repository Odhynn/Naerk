The antagonists of [[Karahath]] opened a Gate to the east of [[Zaelvosh]]'s forest and called some of his strongest servants, among them [[Lovarnian]], a half-fiend tormentor who everyone trembled in his presence. He built a fortress there, [[Cossick]], in which he began torturing people and trading the information he learned. Cossick was built upon a village of elves that lived there, and hardly any elves survived the torture of being captured after an unequal battle.

[[Lovarnian]], in turn, chose a simple method of taking sides. He summoned both Karahath and the chieftains who had turned against him to Cossick one by one and arrested them. What he wanted was to see how convinced each one was of his cause, and to ascertain this he put them through cruel tortures. All but Karahath succumbed on the first day, with most giving up within the first hour. As for Karahath, he quickly grew to respect him, and released him on the third day after healing all the wounds he had inflicted on him. When Karahath ascended to the throne, Lovarnian became his trusted general.
