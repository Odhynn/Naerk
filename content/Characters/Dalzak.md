A dwarf that was born and raised in the city of [[Awlass]]. He fought the [[Guldorom Horde]] in the mountain passes of [[Tarhelm]] and his efforts played a crucial role in the defence of the city. After the war, he dedicated himself to his smithy and earned reputation as one of the best quality metalsmiths of the city. After two decades, he travelled east to [[Mountain Anvil]] and started working in bigger establishments with better quality materials. He joined [[King Rothgrom]]'s attack on [[Dumspergrond]] during the [[War of the Titan]] and since then settled in the recaptured fortress of [[Str√ºmeld]]. His kin praises his deeds during both wars, although he remains humble and dedicated to his craft.
