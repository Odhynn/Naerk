A rusalka and emissary of [[Fallfaunt]] that heard the pleas of [[Ylamir]] during the [[Bladdar Massacre]] and helped him, channeling the power of ice. She later helped him pay his debt by assisting his journey to [[Hoss]] with his undead army from the battlefield. She then helped him with powerful spells to make [[Fol'rish]], a mighty castle in [[Fallfaunt]]'s name. On its completion, Rusalka exacted the sorcerer's final debt: After taking his seed, she killed him and took his heart for [[Fallfaunt]]. He placed it in the center of the palace, and it began to glow with a blue light, as the heart had now become a mighty artifact with immense power. And Almefis became the castellan of Fol'rish, with the undead serving her, while nothing was ever learned about her child: though many believe she is the witch who started the [[Winter's War]].
