A [[Volnoch]] war leader and seasoned veteran and armorer that fought in the [[First Battle of Kiribung]] leading his tribe to battle for the disputed lake of [[Kiribung]]. An experienced warrior but quite short-tempered, as he charged the [[Skra]] head-on. Two dozen warriors were able to escape, while the last ones holding a line of defense fell, including [[Helden]] Curnag, nephew of the shaman [[Uldrek]]. The boy had knocked down five Volnoch warriors with his spear when he confronted Raka. Raka broke the spear with his sword and brought it down on [[Helden]]'s head. The boy stooped down, tripped Raka with the back end of his spear and was the last to leave the carnage.

At the [[Second Battle of Kiribung]], he led the rear of the assault against the [[Skra]] camp and was the first to face [[Meegar]]'s attacking force. He retreated with numerous casualties, his army fleeing after the death of [[Jargon]]. He protected the retreating warriors with arrow volleys against the pursuit.

He held himself responsible for the defeat. Since then, he tried to redeem himself by forcing skirmish attack near the border with [[Skra]] in various parts of the forest.
