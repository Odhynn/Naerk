A pirate lady that held a seat in the [[Pirate Council]]. Her meddling with [[Whistor]] affairs and influence on [[King Raldon]] eventually made her Counsellor in [[Sjemhe]]. She is suspected to work not only in public but also in shadows, as she is believed to have poisoned Raldon's queen wife. Many began to spread the word that she had seduced the king and made him fall asleep, ruling in his stead. She ruled the country for a short period of time and established many contacts and informants, until general [[Kuthnor]]'s coup d'etat put her in prison with the king and he assumed kingship. She was liberated from a secret passage by her pirate crew and forced [[King Raldon]] to open the palace vault under threat of the lives of his sons.

After she escaped and started planing with the [[Pirate Council]] an open war against [[Whistor]]. She had gone to [[Sjemhe]] and [[Almarica]] in disguise and had begun to turn public opinion against Kuthnor. Many believed that the general had taken advantage of the situation to seize the throne, while many were tricked into the belief that Della was the only one who could save the island from a bloody conflict. Her next move was to convince the [[Pirate Council]] not to attack Whistor until she had prepared the situation, but in that regard her plans were ruined.

Among the pirates who disagreed was Captain [[Valus]] from [[Flame Gulf]]. A cruel and sadistic leader, he believed that [[Whistor]] should not be given time to organize its army, and he feared that Della would take all the spoils of the island alone. Already, only a small portion of the king's treasury had ended up in Valus' hands, and he had every reason to suspect her.

After a huge defeat of the royal navy in [[Malgoryn]] from pirates, Della appeared at the palace and addressed Kuthnor, telling him that she could help him if he appointed her as an advisor. Trapped in the face of the gradual destruction of his fleet, Kuthnor accepted, and Della began to learn Valus' plans and reveal them to Kuthnor. As a result of which his fleet was always prepared in the points where Valus attacked. Valus in turn, unable to identify the spy in his ranks, stopped the attacks, leaving Whistor unofficially ruled by a general and an advisor that few had imagined and even fewer trusted.
