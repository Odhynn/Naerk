A pirate lady that held a seat in the [[Pirate Council]]. Her meddling with [[Whistor]] affairs and influence on [[King Raldon]] eventually made her Counsellor in [[Sjemhe]]. She is suspected to work not only in public but also in shadows, as she is believed to have poisoned Raldon's queen wife. Many began to spread the word that she had seduced the king and made him fall asleep, ruling in his stead. She ruled the country for a short period of time and established many contacts and informants, until general [[Kuthnor]]'s coup d'etat put her in prison with the king and he assumed kingship. She was liberated from a secret passage by her pirate crew and forced [[King Raldon]] to open the palace vault under threat of the lives of his sons.

After she escaped and started planing with the [[Pirate Council]] an open war against [[Whistor]].
