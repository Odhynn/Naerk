A pirate lady that held a seat in the [[Pirate Council]]. Her meddling with [[Whistor]] affairs and influence on [[King Raldon]] eventually made her Counsellor in [[Sjemhe]]. She is suspected to work not only in public but also in shadows, as she is believed to have poisoned Raldon's queen wife. Many began to spread the word that she had seduced the king and made him fall asleep, ruling in his stead.
