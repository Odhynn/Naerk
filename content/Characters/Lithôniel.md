Daughter of [[Angaeradh]] and [[Auraelis]].

When Lithôniel grew to be 16, [[Angaeradh]] had a vision, a dream of elves returning to a reborn Selanaar and reclaiming [[Eltirion]]; a possible future the strands of which she could see passing through her daughter. She was overjoyed, for Lithôniel might well grow to be the harbinger of the triumphant return of her people to their rightful place as the watchers over the land of [[Athalaar]]; unfortunately, the Prophetess under the Mountain had the exact same vision.
