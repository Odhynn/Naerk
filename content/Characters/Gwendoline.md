Duchess [[Gwendoline]] Bardatt was a warrior who had served for a decade at the [[Four Winds Monastery|Monastery of the Four Winds]]. She formed her own knightly order, the Knights of Sapurr, who had specially trained war bulls as mounts.

During the [[Decade War of Arbader and South Darrok]], she and her warriors reorganized the army and prepared plans for the next great battle. At the same time, he sentenced dwarves who had spread rumors or attacked their comrades to lay down their arms and to forced labor in the forges of [[Sapurr]] for ten to fifty years, depending on the severity of the offense. This cost almost two companies of the army and the dwarves considered the punishment to be very unfair and one-sided, but the animosities in the army did stop, despite complaints. [[Arbader]]'s attempts to sow discord and target Gwendoline had very limited results in the following period. After a one year truce, she had to suppress several nobles who called for a permanent peace treaty in exchange for [[Llykavann]], and she also changed some renegade captains for other, more suitable candidates.

After the massacre at [[Queenswood]], Arbader's forces began to advance north. They eventually crossed the forest's edge and began to plunder what was left of the [[Volprost Plains]]. Darrok's army had been disorganized but soon managed to regroup in the main camps of Relmon and Irmast. [[Gwendoline]] organized three cavalry battalions with General [[Odr]] and General [[Mennis]] and they plowed through the valleys. On their way they found countless disorganized [[Arbader]] soldiers, who had been far removed from their supplies, and in the open valleys the cavalry had a huge advantage. Their war bulls trampled the soldiers who were looting villages without any cohesion.
