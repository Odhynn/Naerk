Stephan has been a baron for four years in the city of [[Marjalat]]. Many whispered that he had become very introverted and antisocial, and as the years went by, he was venturing less and less out of his villa. His family was traditionally faithful to [[Veiroch]] and his sister had died and became a ghost inside the villa after a ceremony in the name of the God. His brothers, who had died of illness, were much more promising than him. In fact, the one who held the class and consistency in the last year was his wife, [[Anyssa]], who was from the neighboring city of [[Kel-Arga]].

After the tragic events of [[The Blackthroat Disease]], Stephan appeared regretful and it was agreed to stay in power for another eight years, until his heir and nephew, [[Rennis]], would come of age.
