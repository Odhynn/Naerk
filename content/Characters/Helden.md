The nephew of Shaman [[Uldrek]] that fought in the [[First Battle of Kiribung]]. Two dozen warriors were able to escape, while the last ones holding a line of defense fell, including him. He had knocked down five Volnoch warriors with his spear when he confronted [[Raka]] Trell. The second, a seasoned veteran and armorer, broke the spear with his sword and brought it down on [[Helden]]'s head. But he stooped down, tripped Raka with the back end of his spear and was the last to leave the carnage. A warrior went to block his way, but cut his throat with a hunting knife he had.

At the [[Second Battlel of Kiribung]] he led the defence on the [[Skra]] camp against [[Jargon]]'s assault. He called the warriors to form a wall with their shields on the planted spikes of the camp and shouted to hold to the end. But Jargon with his bodyguard, warriors in heavy armor, aided by two druids who were in the form of huge boars, broke through the line of defense at one point and began slaughtering the Skra soldiers. Helden continued to hold the defense, inflicting heavy casualties on the left of the line. With the lake to their side, he knew they had to hold that position, because there they couldn't be surrounded. And despite heavy losses in the center, with Jargon trying to throw them into the lake, they held on until he was relieved by [[Meegar]]'s counterattack and they broke together the now-flanked [[Volnoch]] assault.

[[Trygg]]and Jargon held each others backs while the first killed many warriors. Then, [[Helden]] Curnag attacked [[Jargon]] with his spear, but Trygg pushed him back. The blow though was enough to send Jargon's helmet flying. The rearguard continued to fall back, but then [[Meegar]] arrived, seeing Jargon momentarily unprotected: He climbed a tree, and leapt upon him, driving his ax into his skull. Trygg rushed at the assassin, but it was too late: Jargon was dead. This was a critical morale blow for [[Volnoch]]. They fled, while a few [[Raka]] archers shot arrows at the Skra to stop the pursuit.
