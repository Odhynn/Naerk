## Description

Teeso of the Lavarami family had taken over his duties in the council at year 102. He was young in age, and loved adventure and action. He was a well known tracker.

He has a magically enchanted lynx companion that he replaces by an offspring of selective breeding whenever the previous dies of old age. His current Lynx is named CIV and marks the hundred-and-fourth generation of the original lynx ancestor. His attacks are empowered by rituals to be a bane of undead.

## Decline of [[Zulhan]]

The Ferames family did not hesitate to blame the Lavarami for the decline of the health of prince[[Talkeri]]. They claimed that they had cursed the prince with dark magic in order to have a majority of the council. Therefore, whatever happened to his health, they would be solely responsible. Teeso then, despite realizing the absurdity behind it all, vowed to find a way to cure him, and not return until then. The council would be balanced again, and if he could cure him, the Ferames would be obliged to drop the charges. And his proposal, despite the objections of his own people, was accepted.

Many at the time understood that this oath meant Teeso's banishment for life. But he had sworn in his blood and he intended to keep his oath. At the same time, it seemed at that moment probably the only way to stop the confrontations on both sides, even if only for a while. And so Teeso began his journey. He traveled to the south, to the east, to the west, and to the north, with many hardships and adversities. His final destination was [[Eagle's Reach]], after three months of fruitless wandering.

There, one of the four princes gave him a [[Philosopher's Stone]]: A stone that, according to him, could grant eternal life to its wearer. Teeso took it and returned to Zulhan. He found Talkeri dying: He was coughing up blood, his chest barely rising and falling, and the efforts of the best medics and priests had only prolonged his suffering. Everyone stepped aside as Teeso took out the stone and placed it against Talkeri's chest.

Then, Teeso found that he could not let go of the stone from his hands, and remembered the words of the prince from Eagle's Reach: Eternal life would be given to the user of the stone, and it was he himself who had used it. Even worse, he had hidden from him that the stone had a price of one life for one life. Talkeri, then, paled as the stone took on a dark hue and began to suck his life energy: Within moments, the prince was dead, and Teeso fell dazed to the ground, unable to realize what had just happened. Everyone around him was frozen.

## Civil War

The ensuing civil war shattered what was left of the kingdom. Within hours, most of the Ferames and Lavarami were dead.

## Aftermath

Teeso galloped toward Eagle's Reach, enraged and thirsting for revenge on the alchemist prince who had deceived him. But Talkeri didn't really die.[[Voolthow]] found his soul. and within him the thirst for life, the thirst for power, and enveloped him in his dark magic, taking the sacrifice of all the souls that died in his name. And by the evening of that day, a new terror was to rise from the ruins of the now former empire. He had in his hands an entire army of undead, from the souls of the dead, a gift from the Shadow God: The [[Shadowflame Army]].

## Battles of Shadowflame

Teeso offered his aid and experience as he fought on [[First Battle of Shadowflame|First]], [[Second Battle of Shadowflame|Second]] and [[Third Battle of Shadowflame]] against the undead of [[Shadowflame Army]] to protect [[Kalyr]] village. He tried to redeem himself of his past errors and became a friend with captain [[Keldar]] Hayrill.
