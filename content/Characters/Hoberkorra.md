A giant mutated troll that followed [[Karahath]]'s [[Defeated Army|army]] with his forces. He fought at [[Battle of Fherlon Plains]] and stopped [[Green Hills]] cataphracts from chasing the whole army after [[Petch-cro-Bor]]'s and [[Gorbla]]'s death. He then retreated with [[Arzilok the Tormentor]] to [[Paraselt]] and reorganised his giant troops.
