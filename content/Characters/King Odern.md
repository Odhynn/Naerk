The king of Tarthyn that faced the [[Tarthyn Invasion]] during his rule. He ordered to close the gates to protect [[Silkwin]], but very few had managed to seek refuge inside the city walls. The first wall of the city was also breached after heavy fighting, with many casualties.

The next morning the [[Kambah]] army stopped the attacks. [[Rongerak]] and his entourage appeared in front of the South Gate of the main city with a white flag, ready for negotiations. Very quickly, Odern with his own entourage and [[Grok]] came down to meet him. Rongerak gave him two options, ignoring the murderous glares the king was giving him. Either he would surrender the city, and take his word that he would not continue on to the rest of Tarthyn, or he would grant him all the territory north of Lake [[Tartha]], the [[Pinewoods]] and west of [[Silkwin]]. In each case he pledged to release the captives and return the bodies of the dead, to ensure that the king would agree to negotiate.

Odern found it particularly difficult to answer. Rongerak gave him a day's notice, for he knew he was in danger of [[Green Hills]]' forces coming to their aid. Either he would lose nearly a fifth of his country, or the capital, which was a center of trade and industry, a strong defensive barrier, and seat of the crown. He asked his advisors, and with the exception of one druid and some lords who owned land to the west, most agreed that it was best to save the city. Odern with a heavy heart gave his answer to the Tyrrant, and the next day the siege ended and the captives returned to their families.

His popularity plummeted among many lords and citizens that accussed him of locking the refugees out, as well as selling out a part of his country without a serious fight.
