The daughter of [[Vyrda]] that tried to de-escalate the tense feud between her family and the Bolrags and proposed a [[Wedding Sacriledge|Wedding]] to unite them. She died during this wedding by an arrow secretly shot by a [[Skra]] assassin as a provocation. [[Falgyrd]], her husband for a few hours, avenged her by tracking and killing the assailant.
