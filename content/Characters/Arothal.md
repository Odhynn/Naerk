## Rumors

Much has been told of Arothal the Distant through the ages. Rumors circulating from region to region fall into three categories: According to the first, Arothal is actually a lich, an all-powerful undead who has bought immortality with his own life. According to the second, Arothal is a charlatan, as his magic is not particularly powerful, and he uses it to fool the world and steal what he wants from others. According to the third, he is a demon who has taken the form of a human and whose intentions cannot be known.

Among the many books he wrote is an excerpt [[Regarding the Source of Magic]].

## Origin

All rumors possess some truth, but the true story of Arothal begins many centuries ago. It begins in the heyday of the [[Edhellin]], where wizards had performed unique feats and achievements. Arothal was then such a magician. His parents were rich and influential, and they sent him to learn magic among the most powerful wizards of the time, and one of them was [[Thelar]], of the [[Sarfir]] faction.

Arothal's studies had left his teachers amazed. He could handle divination and teleportation magic with particular ease and soon began writing entire books in which he described his travels to other dimensions and all that he had discovered. Of all the dimensions he had traveled, however, [[Styx]] enchanted him the most. His teachers dissuaded him from traveling there, saying it was too dangerous: But Arothal did not hesitate, and soon began to speak with souls he encountered on his travels. Gradually, he spent more and more time there, for which he was heavily criticized.

When the elven kingdom collapsed, Arothal had taken his measures. He had collected all the magical items and spells he needed to be able to travel eternally, and passed permanently into the [[Ethereal Plane]], from where he continued his travels to Styx. Soon, he was able to perform a ceremony in which he was completely freed from his material body. He won eternity, without becoming undead or a demon.

Those who don't know say that Arothal is called Aloof because he is antisocial and avoids human contact. This is incorrect. Arothal is actually very social, and has been a teacher to many wizards when he returned after a few centuries in the [[Material Plane]]. He founded the [[Twilight Edge]] in [[Belgosreim]], where many famous witches and shamans came from, and still visits them occasionally. However, his travels have now made him a master at detecting any possible instability in the cosmic balance, and his mission leaves him little time for the [[Material Plane]], with no one knowing where he is traveling. This is the real reason it is called Distant.

## [[Principia Magicka]]

During a visit to [[Reisdok]], he met tha newly-formed [[Cornuzel]] and made them respect his inuition regarding the laws of magic. He played a crucial role in first establishing the first form of [[Principia Magicka]], to limit uncontrolled magic abuse.
