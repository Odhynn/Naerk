One of the founding members of [[Tearthis]] and a legendary archdruid. He rules [[Melario Woods]] and is feared and respected by all citizens of [[Oventhart]].

## End of [[Feneg]] and [[Feren]]

Oliven with the help of [[Angasar]] and [[Al]] performed a ceremony on the southern border of dragon [[Feneg]]'s territory, awakening the ancient dragon [[Feren]] â€” who until then everyone thought that he has traveled to another, unknown region - from his long sleep. A fierce and chaotic battle broke out. [[Oliven]] took on the mighty Feren who was stronger and angrier than ever, Angasar fought his firstborn son [[Feneg]] and [[Al]] along with an alchemist, an orc blacksmith, a priest and three guards kept his sister [[Faeg]] at a safe distance to not interfere with the ceremony. Angasar managed to kill Feneg using the help of trees and forest animals. Oliven unleashed a series of powerful lightning bolts that struck and seared the beast and with another lightning bolt at Faeg he knocked the two dragons to the floor, never to rise again.
