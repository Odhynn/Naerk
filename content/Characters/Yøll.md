A celebrated hero of the [[Winter's War]] and [[Totem War]].

The leader of [[Thimvert]], when the waters froze and the [[Icebringers]] attacked from the South Pole, he gathered his ships and travelled north. When the sea froze, he travelled by foot until he reached [[Kultaria]] and joined the Grand Alliance. He fought valiantly on the ensuing battles, with a scouting party trying to assasinate and stop Tayra. He liberated [[Ingotshield]] hold from the [[Icebringers]], found the legendary sword [[Valnir]], killed a giant two-headed linnorm and secured the [[Evergrowing Forest]]'s assistance on the [[Oromil]] battle afterwards. He fought hard and injured the dragon [[Gridvalkur]], that died soon after. 

His body is said to be buried in a hidden tomb at South Pole, at the place where [[Fallfaunt]]'s Avatar first arrived on [[Naerk]].
