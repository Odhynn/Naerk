A celebrated hero of the [[Winter's War]] and [[Totem War]].

The leader of [[Thimvert]], when the waters froze and the [[Icebringers]] attacked from the South Pole, he gathered his ships and travelled north. When the sea froze, he travelled by foot until he reached [[Kultaria]] and joined the Grand Alliance. He fought valiantly on the ensuing battles, with a scouting party trying to assasinate and stop Tayra. He liberated [[Ingotshield]] hold from the [[Icebringers]], found the legendary sword [[Valnir]], killed a giant two-headed linnorm and secured the [[Evergrowing Forest]]'s assistance on the [[Oromil]] battle afterwards. He fought hard and injured the dragon [[Gridvalkur]], that died soon after. After the final battle, he chased with [[Ashiro]] the witch into the South Pole. The witch, after a fierce battle, drew power from the strongest spells she knew, rose into the air in a storm, and froze Ashiro and Yoll into pillars of ice.

Then Yøll's gaze in the storm pointed out [[Tayra]] had unwittingly summoned [[Drokasner]], wandering wildly. Infuriating him, he asked him how he agreed to serve the Witch, and a goddess from the [[Elemental Ring]], as an [[Aspect]]. Drokasner pushed Tayra aside and prepared, charging a bolt of lightning, to finish off Yoll, when he showed the snow and ice all around them, the essence of Fallfaunt. _"[[Fallfaunt|Snow's Softness]]"_ Groaned the barbarian. _"[[Drokasner|Thunderstrike]]. You are one and the same."_

A bolt of lightning destroyed Yoll's ice pillar and knocked him down, sprawling, but he was still alive. His armor, the [[Aegis of the Storm]], had held. He had fallen beside the witch, and was still holding [[Vålnir]]: With a leap, he reached beside her and drove the sword into her chest, knocking her down and impaling it into the ice. He looked at Ashiro, who had also broken free and was futilely fighting the elements of nature, ice and lightning, that were ready to destroy him.

He cried, with his last breath, and all the [[Aspects]] witnessed him. _"Flee back to [[Evergrowing Forest]]. Your purpose here is over. The Winter's War is over."_ He collapsed next to the dead Tayra, his words falling heavy on the Aspects. The [[Icebringers]] melted away in seconds, while the [[Aspects]] all returned to the [[Evergrowing Forest]]: And with them [[Fallfaunt]] returned, to take the place and home she never had, among them: as if she had lived there forever.

His body is said to be buried in a hidden tomb at South Pole, at the place where [[Fallfaunt]]'s Avatar first arrived on [[Naerk]].
