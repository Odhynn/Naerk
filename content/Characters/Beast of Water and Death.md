In the year 4531 the [[Beast of Water and Death]] appeared in Oventhart Dale. [[Ingasto]] delayed it as long as she could until the rest of the pack gathered. When this was done the [[Tearthis]] managed to seriously injure it and confine it to territory it had already taken, but this was at a high cost. [[Biragg]] fell dead. The Tearthis then made Oliven their leader. Oliven took the option of not going against the monster and simply stopping it until [[Chandor]] came. The other two weren't happy with this choice, but they didn't have a better plan themselves. So, that's how the events unfolded.

When Chandor arrived a legendary battle began, with Tearthis and Chandor being the ones who lived to see the light of day. The devastation in [[Oventhart Dale]] was enormous. It should be expected, considering the Beast was a product of [[Hydarax]] and [[Amehan]] himself. For this reason [[Nahema]] gave her permission to [[Malahir]] to go and fix all that was broken in the Dale. Then she collected all the water of the flooded area in [[Obunk]] and the swamp became a lake. Thus, the Boiling Fountain was created with the excess water. It was a lake with a flame deep within it.

_"To mark the [[Fyrlean]]'s victory over Hydarax. To mark your victory over the Beast"_ he told Chandor.
_"The new lakes will make [[Oventhart Dale]] more alive than ever. To represent the victory of life over death. For that is the true power of nature"_ he told the [[Tearthis]] Pack. _"Thank you everyone, for the battle you fought."_
