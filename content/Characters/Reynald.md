The first appointed governor of [[South Darrok]] after the split with [[Northern Darrok]]. He introduced a series of laws for the southern Darrok so that the country could recover.

The laws included strengthening the country's trade and cavalry. Taxation rose in various ways, but many goods were made more accessible with the establishment of permanent caravans across the length and breadth of Darrok's mainland. The main road connected [[Llykavann]] with [[Irmast]], [[Goldencape]] and [[Ekteron]], with a second connecting [[Lamerpad]] with [[Sapurr]], again via Irmast. The one hundred and twenty lords of the country received special tax breaks for breeding horses and for the manufacture and sale of weapons and armor. But Reynald was also called upon to solve other problems that had arisen.

During the start of the [[Decade War of Arbader and South Darrok]], [[Reynald]] was in his dwarven-made tower, with his guard and servants numbering about four hundred. However, when the cyclops approached the tower, they found that it was made of [[Tarhelm]] stone by the craftsmen of [[Talhad]], in the years of the unified [[Darrok]]. They tried stones, hammers and battering rams but the tower did not seem to fall.

The governor remained under siege tn the impregnable tower but was able to communicate with mundane and magical means with his priests through the network of other cities, and on the same day the invasion was known to the farthest corners of the country. Thus, the opposition arose.

Somehow, by the beginning of 4595, Darrok found himself besieging Llykavann and Arbader struggling to hold even that. The tactics of previous years seemed futile now. The losses were enormous and could not be easily replaced. King Laorwick now continued to reinforce the city by sea to withstand the siege while the cyclops kept the attackers outside the walls with huge catapults. Both armies were exhausted by the constant fighting, and so the siege was destined to last a long time.

In total, the fighting for Llykavann continued for five years, until a Peace Treaty was finally signed. It was obvious that no one could change the borders drastically anymore and for Arbader the capital was costing more than it could bear. Llykavann was returned to Darrok and the warriors of the governor's garrison were named heroes of the country. Arbader retained all the lands in the southern plains of Larata and also claimed the city of [[Pangral]], which it had occupied since the beginning of the war. The remaining countries of [[Palaurim]] acted as guarantors for the implementation of the Treaty and so in the year 4601 the last of Arbader's forces returned south.
