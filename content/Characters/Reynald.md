The first appointed governor of [[South Darrok]] after the split with [[Northern Darrok]]. He introduced a series of laws for the southern Darrok so that the country could recover.

The laws included strengthening the country's trade and cavalry. Taxation rose in various ways, but many goods were made more accessible with the establishment of permanent caravans across the length and breadth of Darrok's mainland. The main road connected [[Llykavann]] with [[Irmast]], [[Goldencape]] and [[Ekteron]], with a second connecting [[Lamerpad]] with [[Sapurr]], again via Irmast. The one hundred and twenty lords of the country received special tax breaks for breeding horses and for the manufacture and sale of weapons and armor. But Reynald was also called upon to solve other problems that had arisen.

During the start of the [[Decade War of Arbader and South Darrok]], [[Reynald]] was in his dwarven-made tower, with his guard and servants numbering about four hundred. However, when the cyclops approached the tower, they found that it was made of [[Tarhelm]] stone by the craftsmen of [[Talhad]], in the years of the unified [[Darrok]]. They tried stones, hammers and battering rams but the tower did not seem to fall.

The governor remained under siege tn the impregnable tower but was able to communicate with mundane and magical means with his priests through the network of other cities, and on the same day the invasion was known to the farthest corners of the country. Thus, the opposition arose.
