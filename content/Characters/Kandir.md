A legendary elf archer from [[Four Winds Monastery]]. He took part in the [[Bloodline War]] by defending [[Lamerpad]] and killed with [[Ildish]] the demon spy [[Molroth]]. Then it was revealed that the demons knew of [[Darrok]]'s counterattack plan.

When they arrived atop a pegasus on the [[Bloodline]] it was already late, as most of the faithful were slaughtered. Immediately, he found a vantage point and aimed at the rampaging demon lady [[Erth'rach]]. His enchanted arrow stuck her on the neck, killing her instantly.
