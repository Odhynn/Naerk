## A Curious DIsappearance

As a member of the [[Syvorms Chartographic Society]] and cousin of the new [[Emperor Nalangis II]], Melissa had free access to all of [[Imtaria]]'s libraries. At the same time, she had traveled to almost all the countries of Palaurim and had a special interest in historical books. Melissa had been raised in [[Vaedar]], but had no obligation to rule, and her parents encouraged her to pursue the arts from an early age. Early on, she was among the best and most beautiful dancers in the palace, and many lords asked her parents for her hand in marriage.

But Melissa got them all out of trouble early. She devoted himself to the faith, in a temple of [[Nahema]]. There he began to deal systematically with libraries and written texts, while at the same time she learned to fight in duels and took an oath to protect all works of art and historical relics. And her journey continued in the same way, gradually she began to travel constantly and renounce the advantages of aristocratic life, although she was still respected by all wherever she went.

It wasn't too long before she realized something was wrong. In at least four different cities that he had visited at least twice, he found that the libraries were missing historical documents describing events from previous millennia. Somehow she started looking into what exactly had happened, as whoever was disappearing these documents seemed to be doing a very systematic job. She contacted the [[Hansa]] priests, but they didn't know anything. Several of them were outraged by what had happened, and vowed to help Melissa in any way they could, as their mission was to preserve and spread knowledge.

The most likely suspects Melissa could name were three. In the first case, they were dealing with some [[Steenar]] fanatics who wanted to eliminate an inconvenient piece of knowledge that might be associated with them. In the second case, certain nobles wanted either to enhance their personal collection, or to improve the opinion one had of their family by removing their bad past. In the third case, some conspiracy of [[Yast]] or [[Amehan]] loyalists had an interest in getting some of their worst deeds out of the historical records.

In any case, Melissa immediately founded a mostly secret organization in order to be able to protect the libraries from these thieves and to be able to expose them. The first gathering took place in the year 4812 and was called the [[Order of the Scroll]]. With the help of the priests of Hansa, Sigard, Nahema and various librarians, the extent of the text losses was soon recorded, exceeding a hundred pieces. At the same time, within a few years, the Order of the Scroll had grown to over eight hundred in number, with many of their agents located in almost every major city in [[Palaurim]].
