A leader of orcs from [[Kambah]], she had the reputation of a devoted [[Veiroch]] follower that publicly tormented those disloyal to her. She followed [[Karahath]] south with [[Defeated Army|a huge army]] and fought at the [[Battle of Fherlon Plains]]. She organized a tactical retreat to [[Paraselt]] and many forces rallied to her banner since.
