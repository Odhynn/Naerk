An old friend and distant cousin of [[Ildish]] that served [[South Darrok]] in the [[Decade War of Arbader and South Darrok]]. He garrisoned an ancient fortress in the forest of [[Queenswood]] but his forces were attacked and caught unprepared by a hobgoblin strike team lead by [[Foba]] and [[Yargot]]. He was killed in the ensuing battle.
