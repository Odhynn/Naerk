The younger brother of Lord and Castellan of Syvorms [[Emperor Nilengar I|Nillengar Ragas]] that organised the rebellion that brought the [[Battle of Traitors Field]] and the ensuing fall of Neruso dynasty. He followed his brother to the battle and to [[Vaedar]] and supported his actions and leadership.

Shortly after their arrival at [[Vaedar]] and his brother ascension to the throne, they were both targeted by [[Crimson Steel]] assassins likely sent by [[Oscia]] aristocrats to enforce their diverging interests. Nillengar was on a tour of the city at the time, and the assassins managed to disguise themselves as merchants and slip into the crowd. In an instant, they approached him and threw a knife that pierced his throat. It was enhanced with magic, as in an instant the emperor turned to ash before the stunned townsfolk.

Karys was dining in the palace at the same time, but the assassins were spotted by the guards in time. The guards slaughtered them in seconds before they even reached Karys. After this, Karys, enraged, publicly lynched the captured assassins of Nillengar. The people openly supported him, and Karys, with the help of the palace priests, identified the perpetrators of this attack. The lords of [[Oscia]] quickly tried to escape south, to [[Whistor]], but Karys sent fifty ships to capture them.

The conspirators reached [[Sjemhe]] and hid in [[Crimson Steel]] hideouts. Less than a week later, however, the huge warships of [[Imtaria]] appeared outside the harbor. Faced with the possibility of an invasion of his country, the King of Whistor ordered the Crimson Steel to hand over the culprits. They, with no idea what they could ask for in return, accepted, and the five lords were handed over in chains to the fleet.

Three of them remained in [[Oscia]], where they were publicly tortured for a week before being executed. The other two were transferred to [[Vaedar]], where they suffered a similar fate, although their torture lasted almost a month. After this, Nillengar was buried with full honors, and the new Ragas dynasty was officially established with Karys, First of His Name, as emperor. Oscia lost the title of co-capital, and this was given to Syvorms, which in the following years developed greatly, becoming the official capital of the new [[Syvorms Chartographic Society|Chartographic Society]]. Many noticed during his reign that [[Imtaria]]'s influence in the south was decreasing, but at the same time it was increasing in [[Zolkar]] and the inland sea.
