The leader of the [[Kalenvad]] tribe that rules from his seat in [[Hlafengrond]]. Son of runesmith [[Borlen]] and grandson of [[Olaff]] trollslayer, whose look resembles.

## Early Years

Yuradal looked a lot like his grandfather [[Olaff]], whom he never met, and he was also alike him in personality and willpower. He exuded an aura about him of confidence and determination. And when [[Jarl Fegreth]] finally decided, after pressure from the locals and the Hurtvigsen to reclaim their land, Yuradal was the first chosen by all to join as Galnagh. And he did not disappoint them, as he emerged victorious from [[Vølrad]] in [[Thylhor]], and the territories were returned to the tribe.

Such was the appeal of Yuradal, that all the young warriors called together to make him the new Jarl. Even among the elders, many supported him, and only a small portion of corrupt old men supported Fegreth as a bitter minority. Then Yuradal became Jarl of his clan, but his achievements did not end there. He tamed three giant eagles on his travels to [[Hlafentar]], fought the giants of [[Hither]], making them respect him and even send [[Weknar|their warriors]] to his personal guard.

## [[The Archery Contest of Lord Meeldas]]

The sun on the last day was starting to go down for good when a furry northerner appeared. He was introduced to everyone as Voldosh. Most had no idea what it was and accepted his name, but the elves smiled, for they knew it was not a name but a title of [[Vølrad]]. Without further ado, the northerner headed to the stadium and strung his big bow. Delhan sat up and began to observe him carefully, for he had realized that his bow was even tougher than his own. Discussions died down as several realized the same and focused on the large archer.

The northerner took his time to calculate his targets and drew an arrow to his bow. His first shot tore through the second and third apricots together. Delhan sat up, but knew that from now on it would be difficult for the northerner to do the same again. The northerner with his second arrow dropped the fourth fruit, and with three more arrows the fifth, sixth and eighth. Delhan now knew that he was almost impossible to beat. He stood up and walked closer to Veronica, his eyes shining. He turned to see the last, futile efforts of the northerner.

He wasn't done though. he drew two arrows from his quiver, stooped down, shot the first, and immediately aimed up and shot the second. The first tore the first apricot and was thrown into the air, while the second tore the seventh, the ninth and struck the tenth, just as the first arrow fell from above and the two arrows met in the apricot. Everyone was speechless, seeing his feat, and the northerner casually went to the king and asked for his daughter's hand. [[Meeldas]], true to his word, declared him victorious as the sun set. [[Veronica]] ran to hug him, relieved to have escaped Delhan's teeth.

The lord invited him to his mansion, but the northerner had other plans. He said his ship was waiting for him, and took Veronica to leave. The lord, angry, began to shout that this was not in the agreement. The northerner turned and looked him in the eyes.

"I am [[Jarl Yuradal|Yudaral Kasnajar]], of the [[Kalenvad]]. I have won your contest with honor, O king, and I take the hand of your daughter. Your palaces and your titles leave me indifferent. Farewell!"

And just like that, King Meeldas lost his daughter, and all the succession and alliance scenarios he had in mind were weakened. He ordered them to be stopped, but Yuradal with Veronica willingly at his side, had already made a run for it. They ran down to the harbor and jumped into his drakkar, which set sail for the north. And the king swore vengeance on the northerner who had humiliated him: Sure enough, Yuradal had broken no rule and eluded all the warships that pursued him, arriving safely at [[Hlafengrond]].

## Veronica

Since then, Veronica rules [[Hlafengrond]] at his side, trying to contain her impulsive husband.
