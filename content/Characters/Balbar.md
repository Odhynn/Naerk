A ferocious two-headed troll that was tasked by the hag [[Varushka]] to kill the impostor orc [[Grimson]]. She promised him unlimited power on his success, so he was tempted.

On the way to the snow-covered pass, Balbar orchestrated his ambush. He brought his own warriors who began to throw nets and spears at the orc. But Grimson was an experienced hunter. He dodged the projectiles and jumped onto the rocks, and with his sword began to cut down the trolls one by one. Balbar's minions could not stop him, and Grimson reached their leader. They began to sword fight, but Grimson was much faster. Balbar's body was riddled with gashes, and soon the exiled orc found an opening and cut off his first head. Varushka, seeing that the battle was not going well, cursed Grimson with a spell above that was about to finish off the troll, blinding him. Balbar, seeing him confused, seized him by the leg and dashed him against the rocks, breaking his head.

Varushka kept her promise and empowered Balbar. He took the orc's broken head, necromantically fitted it to the troll's severed neck and the second head from Bar was renamed Grimm: Balgrimm. The troll drew power from his enemy's skull, and renewed his powers with the help of the witch, who settled nearby and gave him ice golems to guard him and immortality for his success.
