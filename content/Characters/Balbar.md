A ferocious two-headed troll that was tasked by the hag [[Varushka]] to kill the impostor orc [[Grimson]]. She promised him unlimited power on his success, so he was tempted.

On the way to the snow-covered pass, Balbar orchestrated his ambush. He brought his own warriors who began to throw nets and spears at the orc. But Grimson was an experienced hunter. He dodged the projectiles and jumped onto the rocks, and with his sword began to cut down the trolls one by one. Balbar's minions could not stop him, and Grimson reached their leader. They began to sword fight, but Grimson was much faster. Balbar's body was riddled with gashes, and soon the exiled orc found an opening and cut off his first head. Varushka, seeing that the battle was not going well, cursed Grimson with a spell above that was about to finish off the troll, blinding him. Balbar, seeing him confused, seized him by the leg and dashed him against the rocks, breaking his head.

Varushka kept her promise and empowered Balbar. He took the orc's broken head, necromantically fitted it to the troll's severed neck and the second head from Bar was renamed Grimm: Balgrimm. The troll drew power from his enemy's skull, and renewed his powers with the help of the witch, who settled nearby and gave him ice golems to guard him and immortality for his success.

Recently, the sons of [[Elder Gorhald]] fought their way through many trolls that [[Balgrimm]] had placed in wait in the frozen passage, as well as various other creatures of the ice. They climbed up an icy waterfall to his lair and began to fight him. [[Pineg]] struck him with his axe, [[Maul]] with his iron fists, and [[Hramm]] with a fine sword. But Balgrimm understood that they had tired to reach him and that he had the advantage. His injuries were not serious. With his club he melted [[Hramm]] into the rocks, fulfilling the first part of the hag's prophecy. [[Maul]] fell unconscious covered in bruises, and [[Pineg]] soon followed as his ax blunted.

The two surviving brothers awoke bound upside down, covered in wounds and frostbite, next to the sleeping troll. He had already eaten Hramm's leg and seemed to be setting them up for a future meal. Maybe the prophecy kept them from dying, maybe they were just too stubborn. They found knives among the belongings of Balgrimm's victims and cut their bonds. They attacked the troll with fury, and stabbed him in the neck and head that was left, and this time he was dead forever.
