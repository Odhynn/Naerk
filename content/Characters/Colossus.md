> As the hundreds of thousands of souls were sucked into the granite colossus, which towered hundreds of feet up the cliff, the ground shook with energy. Veins formed in the stone, which seemed alive with magic, veins filled with the power of another age. One no longer needed to be an expert to realize that the place was emitting an enormous amount of power. And then the realization of how it could be used created a chaotic uncertainty.

A giant statue created and animated life by the [[Rod of Stone and Steel]]. The archpriest [[Hossoth]] tried to take it under his control by offering thousands of souls trapped in the bodies of his death giant warriors. He was stopped by [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]] and the wizard [[Aldastrio]] after a ritual took control of the Colossus.
