A giant statue created and animated life by the [[Rod of Stone and Steel]]. The archpriest [[Hossoth]] tried to take it under his control by offering thousands of souls trapped in the bodies of his death giant warriors. He was stopped by [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]] and the wizard [[Aldastrio]] after a ritual took control of the Colossus.
