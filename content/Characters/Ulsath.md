Born and raised in [[Clapten]], Ulsath was just a kid at the destruction of [[Clapten]]. Only one [[Twilight Veil]] member came to town, an elf named [[Flagwar]]. As he walked through the plundered [[Clapten]], he saw an orc who had killed an elf and was about to kill her child. Immediately, he grabbed the child and chased the orc away, as he himself, although he agreed with the destruction of the city, disagreed with the pillaging and brutalizing the inhabitants. Also, the girl reminded him of his own child, who had died of hypothermia after diving into Lake Rheosbung. So he hid the child with an invisibility spell and told him to run north, where he would be safe.

Flagwar led Ul'sath to a shelter north of the lake, and told her to stay there. She was scared and cold, and had no idea what happened to her family. He made her a shelter with wood and sheep, and taught her basic rules of survival in the cold and wilderness. Until she reached the age of fifteen, he visited her every day and brought her food. Twilight Edge did not want to accept her into their ranks, as the wizards believed that the child was complicit in the city's miasma. So Flagwar continued to watch over her, but she grew up lonely, with only the animals and a few loggers and hunters, who shunned her because they thought she was a witch. This rumor was not unfounded. With the help of Flagwar, Ul'sath had learned some basic spells and was introduced to the first principles of magic, as she was highly intelligent.

But one day, when Ul'sath was 15, Flagwar suddenly disappeared. She began searching the wastelands for him for days, until she questioned the Twilight Edge wizards, who shooed her away and told her to mind her own business. He had despaired, and although he could now support himself, he had no idea what to do. Then, a month after his disappearance, in the dead of winter, a white fox appeared in the shelter. It was snowing and Ul'sath couldn't see her well, but she looked battered. The girl called the animal and it came to the fire, while the witch was able to close the creature's wounds, which were probably from a wolf.

Taking a closer look at the fox the next day, he found that it was not ordinary. Her right eye was blue, while her left eye was white. What's more, she found that the fox understood when she spoke. It wasn't long before he realized that this animal was magical. Over time, she was able to develop a unique bond with him. They could communicate telepathically, and Ul'sath found that the animal could help her even when casting spells. Over time, their bond grew even more, and the fox could memorize spells. Ul'sath named the fox Fangril, and together they began to wander the tundra of Belgosreim, in her quest to discover the world and understand her powers.

Four years later, the wizards of Twilight Edge accepted her into their ranks and gave her the supplies to delve into, but she was treated rather coldly, except by Elerim, an old student of Flagwar. Four decades passed like this, with Ul'sath trying to understand the source of her power. In the year 4760, she was found by her older brother, who had not seen him for two decades. He told her that their other brother and father were dead. The fox over the years has not aged a single day, and they often left the Twilight Edge cave and explored the forests, lakes and wastelands. No one seemed to know what had become of Flagwar, until one day she met a woodcutter who told her he had gone north to the frozen lands of Coldmist. Guided by Fangril, he advanced into these inhospitable regions, where he found Flagwar, dead and preserved in a solid block of ice, beside a frozen waterfall.
Then Ul'sath, in the frozen weather, swore in her master's name to tame the elements of cold and snow. She wandered for five years in the harshest conditions in the north, and managed to survive with her magic, and develop it. Upon her return to the cave, Elerim told her that she was kicked out of Twilight Edge, as she was absent for a long time and lacked discipline. But when he told him that he had found Flagwar's body, his face darkened. He told her that he had always tried to learn the secrets of Fallfaunt, and in order to pass to the next stage, he had to perform a ceremony where he would leave himself open to the elements. Ul'sath demanded that he give her the book of his notes, and when she got her hands on it she found that at least half of the book was written in a language she did not know.

So she said goodbye to Elerim and left, for the first time south, in her quest to find someone who could translate the book. However, she soon came to the conclusion that she couldn't trust anyone, and that she had to find out for herself. Then in the year 4795 he returned to Clapten, which by then had been rebuilt. She moved in with her brother, who had repaired the house near the port and they lived off the thefts. During the next period he devoted himself to the study of various books and wandered about the city. But soon most of the residents started avoiding them and spreading bad rumors about them.
