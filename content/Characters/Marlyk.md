The stubborn son of the murdered [[King Laorwick II]] and hunted by [[Crimson Steel]]. He eventually returned to [[Hashnev]] after hiding for many years. In his endeavor, he found various allies, admirers of the old king, while he even managed to stage his death to reduce suspicions. His hate towards [[King Oodas]] and the Bildarions resulted in an violent yet unsuccesful [[Hashnev, Revolt and Betrayal|revolt]] and his death.
