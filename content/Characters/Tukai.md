A savage child that grew in [[Rammok Wastes]] following the steps of his step-father, [[Tarwos]]. During [[The Last Lesson]], he learnt that his true father, [[Taurlin]], went north in [[Oventhart]] and decided to find his trail.

He is accompanied by his loyal pets, [[Arshak]], a bearded vulture and part of his family, and [[Horra]], a hyena that followed him north.
