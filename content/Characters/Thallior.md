The Lord of the Cataphracts of the [[Luminous Sword]] and nephew of ex-[[King Morran IV]]. He was a squire in [[Battle of Fherlon Plains]] and killed [[Petch-cro-Bor]] while he mortally wounded his uncle. He held himself responsible for the kings' death but his order praised his actions during the battle and he quickly climb through the ranks.

He also fought in [[Battle of the Gap]] and organized a retreat, breaking through the goblin ranks.

When pirates attacked the ship of [[Erdin]] Quakesville, brother of [[King Nurladan]], in [[Sinaxon]], he tried to repel them and fought valiantly, but it was clear that they had been caught off guard. With no time to put on their armor, and with the pirates swarming all over the deck, several of them didn't even get to take part in the battle. The losses were mutual, but in the end the pirates got what they wanted: killing most of Erdin's personal bodyguard, they netted him prisoner and disappeared. Thallior took matters into his own hands, and threw traitor [[Harlyn]] Vonga into prison, while placing three other suspects on hold until the situation was cleared up. As a consequence of this, the Green Hills' relations with Imtaria became very cold, and voices within the realm against the Palaurim multiplied. They accused Harlyn of being related to Imtaria and being an agent, they accused the king of not having trusted him, and they believed that Erdin died because he was a staunch opponent of the alliance with Imtaria and the disastrous campaign in Paraselt. The three trackers were ultimately acquitted of all charges. However, a few days later, Harlyn disappeared from the prison, and all of his guards were murdered in the night.
