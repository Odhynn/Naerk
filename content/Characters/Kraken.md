The kraken first appeared at 4734 in [[Walrus Shores]] and terrorized the whalers. It sunk many ships until it eventually started attacking ports, accompanied by thunderstorms. It is said that it spared the villages that painted their houses with blood from sacrifices to [[Jalerk]], as many tribesmen believe it was her creature. It was repelled in 4768 by an warrior expedition led by [[Jarl Sn√•fr]], that suffered heavy casualties in the process but boasted that they fatally wounded the beast.
