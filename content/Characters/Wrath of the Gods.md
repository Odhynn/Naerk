The Ultimate Elemental, called the Wrath of the Gods, was created by all four [[Elemental Lords]] to avenge [[Ashiro]] for his interference with the [[Malgyra]]. It is destined to hunt him down in all planes of existence. When [[Ashiro]] travelled to the far ends of the [[Void]], the Elemental followed him there, destined to kill him.
