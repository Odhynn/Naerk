A deadly assassin that harnessed the power of shadows. She was an semi-independent member of the [[Order of the Cave]] and sought refuge at a cave in the source of the [[Tail of the Serpent]]. For a brief period of time, she helped and travelled with the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]] during the start of the [[War of the Titan]]. Her tracks are lost since.
