A lizard-like huntress of Styx and member of the [[Vile Septet]] that arrived for his own personal motives after the [[Pyrlon Carnage]]. [[Erth'rach]] settled in the delta of the rivers north, and they were called Krverveka, the Blood Riverlands.

During the [[Bloodline War]], when the alchemist [[Alzagur]] caused the water to sink in the [[Bloodline]] again, she emerged from the poisoned red water and started a bloody massacre along with a company of four-legged amphibious demons who ran and slaughtered all the faithful who had been poisoned by the water and were unable to defend themselves. Of all the demons that day, it is said she killed the most, as she reached the front lines covered in blood. Most of the priests had gone to the front, leaving those behind vulnerable. The beach was stained crimson with blood as the abyssal beasts maimed and tortured the wounded, dead and alive indiscriminately.

When [[Ildish]] arrived on the battle with [[Kandir]] Leafwisperer atop a pegasus, the second found a vantage point and aimed at the demon lady. His enchanted arrow stuck Erth'rach on the neck, killing her instantly.
