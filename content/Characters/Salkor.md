The son of [[Rhekvethor]] that helped him during the construction of the [[Rod of Stone and Steel]]. He was tried in the [[Unnamed Judgement]] and sentenced to 500 years of imprisonment. After he was freed, he devised a way to free his father from his permanent imprisonment. A free and curious spirit, with unknown motives, he dabbled a lot with the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]] until finally he took the Rod, found [[Rhekvethor]] and freed him.

## Plans

When Salkor was released, he began making plans to reassemble the Rod and free Rhekvethor. He went to [[Maeronian]], and asked for his help, and he offered it: The ability to wield powerful magic whilst remain undetected. Maeronian did not know exactly what had happened, and Salkor in order to avoid his questions told him that it was Rhekvethor's wish. With his newfound powers, Salkor began to investigate what had happened to the Rod, but was unable to find out. He wandered aimlessly for a while, until he began to collect sources.

As the centuries and millennia passed, Salkor was able to learn the location of the [[Solarium Rings]], the Rod, and the [[Roaring Diamond]]: But he knew that he would have to move slowly and carefully, so as not to reveal himself: and that when he would take one of them, the rest would be increasingly difficult: therefore, when he took one, he must have some means of taking them all. And so he spent a long time finding holes in the defence of each individual guarding place, and organizing his plan in detail. He went so far as to find [[Tavethir]] and they spoke again after some time, and while Tavethir was bound by the trial, he was able to give Salkor information about the rings, as he knew the injustice that had been done to him and was tired of the eternal burden of custody. Yerastu punished Tavethir with death for his betrayal, which he embraced as a final relief.

It started from the south, from a random event: The ring was kept in a civilization of gnomes underground, which had been ruined years ago. But it was protected by a spell: only an honest gnome could take it from where it was. And he happened to pass by after many years: [[Droghor]] Firan, with the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]]. The ring, as no one knew what it was, was put up for auction: yet it was recognized and bought by an honorable knight, named [[Eberk]] Ironlance. Salkor waited for him to make his move, and took the ring after warning the Band not to interfere with his plans.

In a sudden move, he took the ring, a few months after finding it. At the same time, he had sent the thief [[Saskath]] to the [[Temple of the Sapphire Guard]], in the west, where the second ring was kept, and he was able to successfully steal it, as he was one of the best at his job. At last, he taunted Dumsper that if he broke the Moaning Diamond a second time, he would break the curse: and he believed it, and going to [[Buldigazdar]], guarded by Bodrig and other servants of Tarov, broke its protections with [[Earthquake]], his hammer, and took it to [[Str√ºmeld]]: But with the power of the diamond he was gradually able to break the curse [[Tarov]] had placed on him: Something Salkor was unaware of.

Salkor's next move was to cross the passage leading to [[Tartara]] and take the rod. He got past the salamander [[Innorf]]'s defenses and eventually entered the tornado he was in, with the Band in tow, and took it, in a complex series of events that led to the death of the wizard [[Aldastrio]] and the intervention of demons who also wanted a share of the spoils. But Aldastrio came back to life, with the help of [[Tarov]], and was given a new purpose: to protect the [[Roaring Diamond]] and the creatures of the earth.

The guardians of the rings quickly became alarmed. The blue dragon Akerosoth from the Dragonpact, who had the third ring, found the Band and they went to Ilistair, the temple of Yerastu, where the last ring was. High priest Dorian Sheidahan with his priesthood and warriors took it upon themselves to guard them. All the while, a detachment was sent from the Temple of the Sapphire Guard trying to find out what became of the ring, but their efforts were ineffective. And that's because their leader, Gethsered, was a traitor, and misled the rest of the faithful into his dark plans.

Klemnestron had learned of the events, for a loyalist of his, the ancient red dragon Solusmeir, had led the Band to Innorf. Wanting to benefit from the story as well, he agreed to help Salkor and allied himself with Gethsered, in exchange for the Rod being used in his own interests. The Bloodscales under the supervision of Solusmeir made various moves to stop the Band, but eventually Gethsered told them that the rings were with Ilistair. Solusmeir with Foervian, the leader of the Bloodscales, gathered dragons and soldiers and attacked the temple with fury.

The ensuing battle was fierce, but few could stand against Solusmeir's fury. Moreover, several priests were absent to fight in southern Darrok the Titan Dumsper, who had begun his invasion. The dragon was about to level the monastery when Shizu from the Band called Hikari, who was guarding Rhekvethor, to protect the temple. Hikari killed Solusmeir in a wall-shattering duel, but the Bloodscales managed to get the rings from the injured Dorian and leave in time. The monastery was saved, but the cost was enormous.

Meanwhile, Salkor took advantage of an attack that had occurred on Strumeld by the Band to grab the Moaning Diamond from the Titan. When the Bloodscales gave him the two rings, he went off somewhere, activated his protective spells, and reassembled the Rod of Stone and Steel. With his help, he began to head into the bowels of the earth, towards Rhekvethor's prison. He eluded Menthdravor who was guarding him and as Hikari had returned to the Fortress of the Just, Yerastu's palaces, he reached the prison unhindered and despite the efforts of Droghor and Menthdravor to stop him, he broke through the prison and reached Rhekvethor.

In this effort, a powerful earthquake was created, which awakened a huge creature of fire, forgotten in the depths of the earth since the Primordial War. In a titanic battle that ensued, Rhekvethor with Rod's help managed to kill it, before it blasted the entire surface with lava. But Yerastu sent some of the strongest Kenemi to stop Rhekvethor and Salkor. These were successfully dealt with, causing Yerastu to soon give up his efforts: chaos had won.

The Vethians went after the death of the Titan Dumsper to Strumeld, where they discussed with Shizu, Droghor and Aldastrio about the future of the Rod of Stone and Steel. They wanted to leave the material dimension and couldn't take it with them, but they couldn't let it be destroyed or unused. Eventually it was decided, with Tarov's agreement and Yerastu's tolerance, that the wizard Aldastrio would take the Rod, and use it with a newly formed order: The Order of Blood and Brimstone. And Salkor and Rhekvethor returned to Zinctizuctra, and since then little has been heard of them: though Salkor is rumored to visit Aldastrio now and then.
