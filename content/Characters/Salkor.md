The son of [[Rhekvethor]] that helped him during the construction of the [[Rod of Stone and Steel]]. He was tried in the [[Unnamed Judgement]] and sentenced to 500 years of imprisonment. After he was freed, he devised a way to free his father from his permanent imprisonment. A free and curious spirit, with unknown motives, he dabbled a lot with the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]] until finally he took the Rod, found [[Rhekvethor]] and freed him.
