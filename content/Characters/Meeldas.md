The eccentric lord of [[Vaensir]] and father of [[Veronica]]. The year 4816, he proclaimed that he would hold the [[greatest archery match|The Archery Contest of Lord Meeldas]] [[Tol-Gera]] had ever seen, as he was a great fan of the sport. Invitations were sent out to all the neighboring lands, from [[Imtaria]] to the [[Green Hills]], and from [[South Darrok]] to [[Oromil]]. And as an incentive, the king announced that he would give a bigger prize than ever to the winner: The hand of his only [[Veronica|daughter]]. To his dismay, the best archers of the contest, [[Aeluril]] and [[Silien]], were not to his liking as a promising son-in-law. He favored the imminent winner, [[Delhan Poglu]], but he in turn was also beaten by [[Jarl Yuradal]], that took his daughter in secret and departed for the north, leaving the Meeldas angry and frustrated. He swore vengeance on the northerner who had humiliated him, but he was nowhere to be found.
