## Early life

Born in Wolvsden, a small northern [[Arlas]] village which was built by a pair of humans, an armorer and a ranger 800 years ago. It is located in the north, near an iron mine. The village is famous for the armor and bows it makes from their ancestors, which the descendants have perfected. It has become famous in various areas because of the excellent scale armor it creates, which is made from high-quality steel and dire wolf leather (there are several groups near the village). The village is almost exclusively populated by armorers and rangers.

His twin sister Ildrith and he were born to a pair of rangers who were very well-known because they were both accompished archers. As they grew up, he didn't show any development in the bow, as it felt a bit awkward in his hand and he didn't like it at all. His sister, on the other hand, was an natural archer and had gained the respect of the village since she was 14. They worked with him, but deep down everyone was mostly drawn by his speach rather than archery.

He liked most playing with a greatsword that his father had hung in the main room of the house. One day he showed him some moves, and from then on the child went crazy and spent all day playing with the sword. The village had various ceremonies throughout the year, one of which was the annual wolf hunt, in which they often lost many people. One of the harshest traditions of the village was the coming-of-age ceremony, in which every child (both boys and girls) had to kill at least one wolf (with a bow), and return with his fur. Each person was given 10 special arrows, which were called Ulvmester and are specially designed for wolf hunting. Because wolves always move in packs, hunting them requires special skill and speed, one mistake and death is certain.

## Comming-of-age Ceremony

When his sister and him reached 17, the time came for their coming of age ceremony, with many visitors from all over the world gathered in the village to feast and enjoy the festivities. His sister left first and returned the next day with 6 wolf furs. Apparently, the whole village was amazed, the elders of the village brought 4 furs at most, so my sister set a crazy record for her age. She had a mocking attitude, towards him, but he ignored her.

The next day, his turn came. They gave him a quiver and a bow, which he threw into the snow, turned his back on them and started. Many people were shouting and cursing, but he ignored them and continued. They thought that he would be dead in 5 hours at the most... Yet he returned after 4 hours, carrying 13 furs on his back.

As soon as he started, he met a pack that was coming towards the village to attack on a rare occasion. Seeing his doom before his eyes, he decided to apply to the extreme what he had taught himself for so many years. At times in the madness he felt that he was dancing, that he could cut off the heads of the wolves two by two with ease, not feeling their attacks and enjoying the battle and the bloodshed to the fullest. So he turned back, where he took the obvious respect from his compatriots. This is where his story truly begins, as he was slaughtering the wolves, the leader and teacher of the [[Hurtvigsen]] school in south [[Hlafentar]] happened to be nearby and watched the fight, who had come for the annual hunt. He asked his parents to take him and teach him the sacred art of the sword and apparently they agreed.
