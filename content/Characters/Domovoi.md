## Story

A huge orc that was originally a blacksmith deep in [[Paraselt]], Domovoi joined the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]] during their adventures in [[Oromil]] and [[Markesh]] and proved his strength against numerous foes. He fought at [[Battle of Fellgaunt]] and he single-handedly killed fifty enemy warriors before he was knocked down. Even [[Karadosh]] was impressed by his combat ferocity, and granted him his blessing, as he rose to fight again and took down thirty more warriors. After a quarrel with the cloud giants of [[Queen Ralvia]] at the stairs before [[Four Winds Monastery]], Domovoi tried to follow his group on a retreat through the main gate, when he was greviously injured by huge javelins thrown by the giants. He returned to fight and save his friends, with a reckless undying rage. He killed five of the queens' bodyguards and, in his dying breath, he lodged his scythe in the Queens' torso, killing her. This act is said to be the start of the [[War of the Titan]].

Domovoi's soul started wondering [[Styx]] but was anchored to his weapon, a scythe made of stygian steel. He became imprisoned there, in a constant struggle against the souls of the dead and demons that tried to take him with them.
