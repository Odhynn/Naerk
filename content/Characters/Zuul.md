One of the biggest and oldest linnorms of the North, Zuul was most of the time sleeping in his underwater cave complex in [[Åperbung]]'s biggest island. At year 4786 he awoke and spread destruction on the lake's shores, killing and displacing numerous [[Bur'gg]] locals. He was slain after a fierce battle, during which he clang desperately to life and seemed deathless.
