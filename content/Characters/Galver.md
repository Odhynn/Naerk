A legendary berserker that fought the wendigo armies at [[Totem War]]. He single-handedly faced three of them and managed to kill one before his companions helped him. He sustained heavy injuries from shadow spells that tormented him for two years, until his death.

His spirit appeared during a [[Torniv]] gathering at the beggining of the Last Harvest in year 4818 and proposed to find four chosen by picking lots amongst the tribes in order to find and activate all the [[Runestones]] of the [[Aspects]].
