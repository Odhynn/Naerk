## Story

A proud and selfish dragon, Haldisoir argued with [[Akerosoth]] for a [[Disputed Feast]] and won. He found and mentored [[Droghor]] Firan to the ways of arcane fire for several years. He eventually became friends with the gnome and tried to help him during the [[Battle of Fellgaunt]]. After a tough battle against enemy forces, he passed his power to Droghor and was turned to a brass statue. [[Chesreth]], a cultist of [[Bloodscale]] found him and restored him on the condition that he would kill the dragon [[Fildagar]] and give him the [[Solarium Rings|Solarium Ring]] that he was guarding. On this condition he agreed, but little did he know that [[Fildagar]] was already dead, Akerosoth had the ring and the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]] convinced him to ignore his promise and leave. Afterwards he took off and reinhabited a solitary lair to [[Farluin Mountains]], near Markesh.

Little did Haldisoir knew that the gift upon [[Droghor]] was bestowed by an ancestor of his, [[Hrondoshel]], and he simply was the conduit.
