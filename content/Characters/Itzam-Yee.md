Itzam-Yee, according to the Chronicles of [[Xe'Farom]], was one of the first inhabitants of the city, which was still a village at the time. Apparently, he was one of the writers of the chronicles, so their reliability in this matter is not certain. A Vethfolk, who had come as an immigrant from a long distance, settled in Allwick trying to leave behind his unknown past and start a new life.

He quickly discovered the existence of the [[Veth Spikes]], which he began to study. His notes, which were soon published in books, are still considered the most complete work on the subject today. With the Veth Spikes, he understood that there was a huge pump of power in the area, with limited spatial boundaries, that offered the possibility of creating powerful magical effects.

He called mages to the previously inhospitable area, and explained them how the [[Veth Spikes]] worked. With basic spells, they were soon able to significantly improve the buildings and the quality of life in the city. Soon, they also solved the problem of water and food selectively, as Itzam-Yee and many other magicians used their magic only on those who were useful to them. Soon, many injustices arose in the growing city, bloody clashes with many citizens as victims that were suppressed with magic spells and weird [[Vethians]], as well as in some cases mage enforcers.

Watching the developments, the wizard understood that the situation was a dead end. More and more residents would come to the city, seeking their fortune, and the conflicts would become more and more intense. No one could take control, as two different magicians using the power of the Crystals would create unpredictable magical results, and possibly even destroy the city. Most magicians had access to his notes by now and had realized for themselves the impasse that lay before them.

One day, while Itzam was floating on a crystal, he realized that his floating spell had ended. However, he was still five feet from the crystal. Curious, he got down and noticed that air was blowing at his feet. Looking more closely, he noticed that there was a gas coming out of the ground, which had a light purple, almost transparent color. He called it Kathelium, and began to study it. He found that it was in many places in the area, and that it had an upward trend, as it was lighter than air. However, with the use of magic, one could manage this buoyancy in such a way as to multiply its power.

In a mage council, he presented an entire cart full of materials floating, then let it fly high, until it disappeared into the air. Quick and clever, all the mages began to exploit this information, but Itzam-Yee was first once again. Within a few weeks, he had his house ready, many meters above a crystal, making it literally inaccessible. A spiral staircase went up and down at his command, while he constantly added new rooms.

At the next mage council, he proposed the creation of levels in the city, in the places where the Kathelium gas was present. The wizards found that this was indeed possible, and gradually other flying houses began to appear. With constant study and experimentation, entire rocks began to float, hosting academies, shops for wizards and magical objects, as well as houses for alchemists and other strange creatures. Obviously, there were also accidents, and for safety reasons Itzam-Yee defined in his books that the correct permanent height of hovering is one third of the maximum that each wizard could reach the corresponding object. For periods of a few hours, this could be magically increased to half, and for a few minutes it was safe to two thirds, in cases of storm, riots, etc.

Thus began the development of [[Xe'Farom]], and by raising buildings they solved many military and administrative problems. Itzam himself experimented with many spells in the palace he had now built, and is considered the city's greatest benefactor. Even the gods were forced to take measures to limit the power of his city, and when he realized this, he felt that this was the greatest reward for his labors. A secondary reward was the view of [[Oromil]], [[Edhelwood]], and [[Paraselt]], when his palace reached for a few minutes the outrageous height of ninety-four miles: A feat that even today is considered unattainable for other wizards. In his notes he writes that he reached so high that there was darkness and [[Naerk]] looked tiny: but most doubt this claim.
