The lich and councelor that ruled the Kalistrom family in Fellgaunt, is thought by many to be the main reason of the [[Battle of Fellgaunt]]. Eventually his keep was razed to the ground and his fate was sealed. It is believed that he was mauled to death by a ruby golem called by the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]].
