A captain of [[South Darrok]] that served as a dragonrider of [[Nentha]] in [[Sunshine]]. His loyal dragon was [[Stenthix]] the silver.

During the [[Decade War of Arbader and South Darrok]], he returned hastily to his country and the governor [[Reyland]] appointed him as a general to lead the resistance of the country. Torris appointed his brother [[Mennis]] as his lieutenant general, as well as the elven wizard [[Ildish]] Tetharym and split the army into three separate groups under their leadership to organise the defence of the vast plains. He built fortifications south of [[Irmast]].

Some months later, Laorwick's main body attacked the western [[Volprost Plains|plain of Volprost]]. An entire battalion of Bugbear was the vanguard, having unleashed hundreds of wild wolves on Torris' army the night before. Without any sleep, Laorwick's knights faced their southern counterparts in a massive battle with fifteen thousand cavalry and infantry on each side. However, fatigue and doubt soon began to gnaw at Darrok's ranks, and when the first soldiers from the irregular battalions began to retreat, the knights soon found themselves surrounded. Only the immediate intervention of Torris on his dragon saved his warriors from complete slaughter. His losses exceeded three thousand, among them many of the knights' elite.

With several short battles to follow, Torris found himself retreating from Volprost with heavy losses. He asked for help from [[Mennis]] but only two companies rushed to help, as many battalions had returned freed "prisoners" and spies who had begun to breed discord in the army. The majority did not trust Torris and considered that he did not have the luxury of asking for help as they said that his tactics were wrong and that he should hold out alone.

Laorwick's plan however was to stop the attacks for a while and for the [[Crimson Steel]] to take over and assassinate Torris from within as a result of the accumulated resentment towards his person. Indeed, several disgruntled men attempted to rebel against the "imported" general, as they called him. The majority of these were dwarves, some of whom had been brought as prisoners before Laorwick and had been brainwashed by his lies, and there were also a number of hidden Crimson Steel. The dwarven rebellion took place early the following year.

The [[Crimson Steel]] attacked Torris one night and used a large crossbow that was next to his dragon [[Stenthix]] to kill him on the spot. Taken by surprise, Torris awoke and fought his assassins valiantly with only a few guards by his side. He laid down several dead, but he too eventually fell when a scythe-wielding assassin known as [[Wallot]] stabbed him in the back, the point of which pierced his armor. When the blade touched him, he turned pale and within an instant he was dead.

He is the great-great grandfather of King [[Labelas]] Lionhead.
