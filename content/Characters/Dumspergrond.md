## History

An ancient titan, predating the age of man, that landed onto [[Naerk]] from ages unknown. During the construction of the [[Rod of Stone and Steel]], he was tricked by [[Salkor]] onto breaking a sacred diamond of [[Tarov]] with his hammer, [[Earthquake]]. He apparently thought he would get the diamond for himself, so he accepted. With his hammer he struck the diamond with all his might. The diamond was cut from the rock, releasing incredible energy and destabilizing the entire mountain. A huge earthquake immediately followed, cutting the [[Tarhelm]] mountain range in two, destroying countless orc and dwarven settlements on the mountain, and creating a huge chasm across the mountains. This destruction enraged [[Tarov]], who cursed Dumspergrond to never see the light of the sun again and be forever trapped on earth. Salkor had of course taken the diamond and disappeared. Try as Tarov might, she couldn't find out what happened to the diamond when she realized the titan didn't have it.
 
During the [[War of the Titan]], he gathered a huge giant army that feared and respected his power and led them to a campaign attacking [[South Darrok]]. They destroyed many villages and towns, marching south and leaving no survivors. He was killed in Ekteron by [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]].
