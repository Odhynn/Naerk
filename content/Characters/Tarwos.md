A nomad hunter, old friend of [[Taurlin]] and the step-father of [[Tukai]]. With the help of his elders and his wife [[Haddam]] he grew and taught Tukai how to survive and hunt in the wild, and in [[The Last Lesson]] he told him about his real father as he was about to leave. He travelled to [[Green Hills]] and fought against the invading goblins of the [[Defeated Army]]. Afterwards, he accompanied [[Raefibb]] to a journey in [[Allwick]].
