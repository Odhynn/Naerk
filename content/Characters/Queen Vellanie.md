The Queen of [[Kelonarie]] and ex-lover of [[Talyrian]], the winged messenger. In her arrival from [[Evergrowing Forest]] to Kelonarie, she made the first efforts to build [[Verhalith]], and many other fey were aspired and motivated by her example and followed her. The city was a breathing marvel of nature, filled with the best works of art the fey realm could offer.

## Grief

However, when [[Talyrian]] had to attend her duties elsewhere, she left, and the Queen was filled with a deep greef. Vellanie resigned her leadership, heartbroken, and disappeared into the forests. The music became distant, the colors dull, and the breezes sad. The birds did not chirp and no flowers bloomed on the trees. The magical Portals of the city were closed for good. The branches on the trees leaned down, and the leaves fell. Even the plants seemed to cry in her absence, and a mist covered the forest, said to be from the tears of its creatures. And the forest has since become known as the [[Forest of Tears]].

Many attempts have been made since then to bring [[Talyrian]] back, but no one has been able to find the Winged Messenger. She herself wanted to return, but she knew that she would not be able to see the beauty of [[Verhalith]] again for a while and then leave again, while she knew that she had made the Queen Vellanie unhappy: And out of shame, she avoided her. The dull colors and distant music have become a habit in Kellonarie, which is home to all sorts of outcasts, but seems unable to return to its former beauty.

Queen Vellanie's intense grief had left the palace dark and silent. At its peak, stood a sentient tree, Azureleaf, that had been her longtime friend and was directly influenced by her. Gradually, all of its leaves fell off, and its roots and branches wrapped around the palace to deter visitors. At the same time, a cunning creature arrived at the palace, [[Maldithrin]], a one-eyed, bat-winged beast who changed shapes and managed to trick the queen into becoming her advisor. As time passed, he managed to sideline all of her close servants and advisors and had them banished, imprisoned, or summarily executed.

Maldithrin fed on the queen's frustration, and remained in the palace like a parasite. Gradually, as Azureleaf strengthened the palace walls, it became completely cut off from the outside world, and acquired its own microclimate: Static, endless, and full of negative emotions. Inside the palace, time seemed to have stopped, the queen lost track of the days, and Maldithrin practically took over the entire administration of the kingdom. He made sure that no one bothered her and limited her appearances to a minimum. He brought his own guard, various exiles and criminals of the [[Evergrowing Forest]], as well as undead guards and spirits.

The very existence of the palace was tied to Azureleaf, and he in turn believed that Maldithrin was the queen's friend, and protected her: but he used her tears to water the tree and gradually Azureleaf began to acquire Maldithrin's perspective, as time passed. The decades became centuries and the centuries became millennia, and the queen remained in his control, while the tree had now become his ally and sought victims to feed on their negative emotions. Those who challenged Maldithrin and his authority ended up in prison, and the most audacious were tortured or executed, or worse, turned into deformed beasts, slaves to his whims.

## Closing Wounds

In the year 4727, a wizard traveling through the city saw a painting of the queen on a canvas and was fascinated. With a divination spell he was able to see her, locked and desperate in the tower, and fell in love with her. He decided to send her a letter expressing his feelings in the form of a poem, but it never reached her, as Maldithrin controlled all the documents that reached her. So, he found three local adventurers, a catfolk and two fairies to deliver the letter, emphasizing that it was strictly for her. [[Talyrian]] gradually gained an interest in the messengers and began to watch closely, but she could not interfere. She was their protector and the message had to arrive, but she could not enter the palace.

The three messengers secretly entered the palace through the sewers, through a route that an former escapee had found. They fought Maldithrin's guards and the palace defenses to ascend to the higher levels. They freed the prisoners, and after hide-and-seek, fighting, and chasing, they reached the queen's chambers where Maldithrin attacked them, determined to prevent them from delivering the letter at all costs. They severely wounded him with the help of a palace guard and drove him off. He sought refuge at the top of the palace, where Azureleaf had taken root.

Thus, the letter reached the queen, and she, reading it, emerged from the oblivion she had been in for so long. Slowly, the palace defenses receded and time began to flow normally. The queen gradually realized what had happened, but she needed time. The messengers reached the top, where they fought the corrupted Azureleaf, and killed Maldithrin that had taken refuge in its branches. After a fierce battle, the tree, scorched and cut down, wrapped, choked and killed the messengers with its roots, sucking the life out of them. However, they managed to purify it, cutting off the branches that Maldithrin had poisoned, and together with the queen, it gradually found its old lost self.

The queen gradually restored her power over Verhalith and the forest, but the wounds of the past would take a long time to heal. New flowers timidly emerged in the forest, and the satyrs for the first time began their first cheerful music. Life seemed to be returning to Kelonarie, after a slumber of millennia. As for the messengers, their souls reached the Evergrowing Forest and Talyrian, to make amends for her own mistakes, made them her servants, animal-like otherworldly creatures who patrol over the planes and further her goals: However, they soon realized that they had the freedom to act in any way they wished.
