The ex-Jarl of [[Kalenvad]] and a friend of [[Olaff]], his appointed protector. They became friends after Olaff protected him from an ambush of twenty trolls.

One of the Jarl's many journeys south proved to be very dangerous, as the locals wrongly believed them to be [[Nagstad]] raiders and attacked them. After a bloody last stand, the northeners were slaughtered one by one after their ship was burned. [[Jarl Forjod]] was captured for ransom. Olaff killed fifty six warriors of the locals before he was taken down.
