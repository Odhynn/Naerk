A servant of [[Yerastu]] and reknowned warrior of faith, he helped during the construction of the [[Rod of Stone and Steel]]. [[Salkor]] did not trust him due to his faith and didn't reveal him all the information about the artifact. He was tried in the [[Unnamed Judgement]] amd found a collaborator to the chaos caused by the rod's usage. His punishment was to make sure that the rod would never be found or used again. For this purpose, his lifespan was vastly magnified, until he finally failed his duty at the year 4777 and eventually the rod was found. [[Yerastu]] sent powerful [[Kenemi]] servants to kill him, and he died bravely in combat, killing one of them.
