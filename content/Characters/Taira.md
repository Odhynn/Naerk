A high priestess of [[Nahema]] that took part in the [[Bloodline War]]. She insisted that the army should siege the initiative from the demons and counterattack on the [[Bloodline]]. Unberknownst to her, her proposition was encouraged by a demon lord, [[Molroth]], that was in the council in disguise taking the form of the diseased emissary [[Olken]].

With her battle plans conveyed to the enemy, she marched to her doom, as the [[Vile Septet]] springed a trap in the [[Bloodline]]. When the line flooded and her force was split in two, she attacked bravely and managed to establish a foothold in the eastern beach, though with huge casualties. They had underestimated the zeal of the faithful and [[Taira]]. Nahema's power was like a light in their banners and hearts that could not be extinguished by the [[Abyss]]. Her poweful spells kept the demons, for a time, at bay. Eventually she got tired and her light faded. It was then that [[Mir'girra]], a demon general appeared with her reinfocements and killed her.
