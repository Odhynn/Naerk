## The Dragon of [[Wolf's Mouth]]

A powerful creature with a huge treasure hoard. Its size and display of magical powers indicate that it has lived for well over a millennium, though no one knows where it was or where it grew up before finding a new home in [[Wolf's Mouth]]. One thing is for sure, he is very good at not making enemies and those who are his enemies are still breathing only because he allows it, with little excuses, which makes perfect sense, since we are talking about the largest black dragon alive.

Seriatul adheres to [[Dragonpact]], regardless of the fact that many settlements are within its territory. This only happens because he allows it, with a corresponding fee from their part. A fee which is considered by many to be too small, although according to [[Chandor]] this happens so as not to create enemies. He also lets the linnorms have nests in the surrounding mountains and he is the overlord of [[Ralzyn]].
