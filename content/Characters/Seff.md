Son of [[Solthys]] that tried to dethrone his tyrrant father from [[Wolfkeep]] with help from [[Alerius]], the first werewolf there. They found several followers in their attempt, and one night, in the winter of 4755, they murdered him, along with his loyal servants.

In order to keep the cohesion of the city, Seff was also declared warlord himself, but he significantly reduced the raids. But the situation in the city was very bad. Famine had gripped all the inhabitants, and soon many began to desert Seff to begin wanton raiding.
