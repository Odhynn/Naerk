A gluttonous and easily bored king. He was mostly known for his tolerance against [[Khalaram]]'s disobedience and his inability to defend [[South Darrok]] against [[Dumspergrond]]. During his reign the [[Khalarsnake]] were funded and supported and soon became an uncontroled force. He was criticized heavily for his dormancy. When the armies of the Titan [[War of the Titan|invaded]] the country, the council forced him to resign and the famous strategist [[Labelas Lionhead]] was crowned as the new king in his place after the war.
