An powerful hag witch that was displaced from dragons during [[The Blaburry Expansion]]. She tried to gather as many forest warriors as he could in time, and appointed Nymph [[Queen Valauri]] as deputy leader, who could control the animals and plants in the east of the forest.

During the battle, she assaulted with [[Queen Valauri]] a captured fey cave that was base for [[Klemnestron]] cultists. They killed most [[Bloodscale]] and lizardfolk, as well as the mighty dragon [[Alfavriix]] and saved the forest by restoring nature's balance. Still, Valauri was captured with many other fey by [[Ozrallon]], [[Alfavriix]]'s son, and tortured for many decades. She was slain and her spirit bound in place.

Many decades after, in 4818, a group of travelers found Ozrallon's lair. Once Flux told them what happened, they attacked the lizardmen, freed Valauri, and with her help killed Ozrallon and took [[Tikimura]] to the Evergrowing Forest for her final resting place. The temple was destroyed and Valauri restored the nature to the area and forgave [[Flux]] for his betrayal.
