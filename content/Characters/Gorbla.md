One of the most influential goblin shaman leaders of [[Hoen]], she was rallied to [[Karahath]]'s cause after he offered her protection from giant attacks. As a tribute, she followed him to fight with [[Defeated army|his army]] and formed battalions totalling almost eighty thousand goblins. She was killed by arrows during the [[Battle of Fherlon Plains]] after her protective magic was exhausted. Her army retreated to [[Paraselt]] but swore revenge against [[Green Hills]].
