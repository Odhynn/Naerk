Sethayasar, or smuggler Seth, a veteran sea wolf and well-known smuggler in [[Stormsfall]] and [[Alagon]] that managed to fool the local authorities for several decades. When they finally caught him in [[Stormfall]], they decided that the arena would be the most practical end of his journey. He was sent to the [[Marleon]] arena in [[Hashnev]] for execution. Even though he was believed to have died in the arena, he evaded death and has ascended to a pirate lord of [[Meeran Gulf]]. His flag is a Bull's Head with Eyes like a Woman's Breast: a tribute to a [[Condor|minotaur]] that saved his life and a woman he never had.
