Once a famous adventurer, Laorwick fought several battles against monsters and formed the Brownswords, the elite order of law in the country. After he united the kingdom, he was crowned a king. During his reign, the country flourished until several nobles that rose during the gold rush started to undermine him. The [[Crimson Steel]] killed his fellow associates in several cities until finally he was murdered by assassins during a trial in [[Hashnev]]. Chaos followed his death.
