The youngest son of [[Elder Gorhald]], the ex-leader of the [[Dal'Vorag]] tribe. Brother of [[Hramm]] and [[Maul]].

One night, Gorhald called his sons to his tent. He told them the story of [[Grimson]], and that whoever brought him the skull would become chief of the clan in his place. The three brothers lost no opportunity to prove their worth and take command of the tribe, and next morning they prepared to leave for [[Legthir Pass]]. [[Koldrag]], a distant descendant of Grimson, led them to the pass after a long journey, where he built a shelter to wait for them, as there was frost everywhere.

Despite the cold, the three young men gritted their teeth and took the climb. There they were attacked by a Wolf of Fosh, a huge frozen predator, who was a servant of [[Varushka]]. They found her a little later, but as much as she wanted to, she couldn't immediately take revenge on them for their act. But he could with the power from the Norns curse them, and that she did. Her prophecy said that of the three brothers, the first would be hated by everyone, the second would go mad, and the third would die young.

Disregarding the crazy hag as they saw her, the brothers continued on their mission. They fought their way through many trolls that [[Balgrimm]] had placed in wait in the frozen passage, as well as various other creatures of the ice. They climbed up an icy waterfall to his lair and began to fight him. [[Pineg]] struck him with his axe, [[Maul]] with his iron fists, and [[Hramm]] with a fine sword. But Balgrimm understood that they had tired to reach him and that he had the advantage. His injuries were not serious. With his club he melted [[Hramm]] into the rocks, fulfilling the first part of the hag's prophecy. [[Maul]] fell unconscious covered in bruises, and [[Pineg]] soon followed as his ax blunted.

The two surviving brothers awoke bound upside down, covered in wounds and frostbite, next to the sleeping troll. He had already eaten Hramm's leg and seemed to be setting them up for a future meal. Maybe the prophecy kept them from dying, maybe they were just too stubborn. They found knives among the belongings of Balgrimm's victims and cut their bonds. They attacked the troll with fury, and stabbed him in the neck and head that was left, and this time he was dead forever.

And then the size of the hag's curse became imminent. Maul's judgement became clouded and had a headache, while Pineg, paranoid, believed his brother wanted to betray him and go off on his own. The two brothers came to blows, and Maul emerged victorious. He left Pineg for dead, took all the loot in the cave along with the head, and returned to the waiting Koldrag. When asked where his brothers were, he replied that they were killed by trolls. They took the long way back to the tribe, with Maul already feeling like a leader within him.

Pineg regained consciousness much later. He had lost half his fingers to frostbite and was in a miserable condition. He dragged his dagger towards the nearest being who could help him, who was none other than the witch. Varushka, happy to be in complete control of the situation, found that Pineg could be of use to her. She sent him to distant [[Fol'rish]], Hoss's frozen palace, to bring her [[Ylamir]]'s corpse in exchange for Maul's death. Pineg had no choice but to nod.

After a difficult journey there and back, he managed with much difficulty to accomplish the task. He had changed completely: his face had become determined, and his skin had hardened and turned pink from the cold. He was able to pry [[Ylamir]]'s corpse from his heart, which was bound to the palace, and brought it to the witch. She created an undead from the corpse, merging Ylamir's soul with that of the dead [[Hramm]], and revealed to Pineg her true plan. The new Hramm would kill Pineg and take over the leadership, allowing her to directly control the Dal'Vorag clan.

Pineg tried to fight back, and Varushka invoked a spell to kill him, as he was now useless to her. But then the [[Norns]] intervened: their daughter had far exceeded her role. He tried to kill Maul before his time, and resurrected Hramm when he was supposed to die. And for this life, the price would be the highest: Her life itself. Drokasner produced a sudden bolt of lightning, which fell violently upon her, charring her in an instant. Silent and vindicated, Pineg gathered up what he found useful there and started down the frozen passage to turn south. His gaze flashed, unpredictable and fierce, while the undead Hramm followed silently behind him.
