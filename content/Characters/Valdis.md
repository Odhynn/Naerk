The archpriest of Sergonial is a cunning man who knows well when to participate in a play and when to end the show. He prefers not to take the initiative himself, and is particularly adaptable to new situations. A close ally and subordinate of [[Ternath]] that is supposed to have played his part during [[Hashnev, Revolt and Betrayal]].
