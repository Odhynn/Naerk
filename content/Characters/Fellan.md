A dread pirate and subordinate of the infamous Pirate Captain [[Valus]]. Captain of the mighty ship [[Genie Stride]] that spread terror over most of eastern [[Whistor shores]]. He was injured during the naval battle in Molhorys and lost his ship, so he took over the command of a smaller ship that they captured in the battle and he renamed it to [[Genie Soul]]. Later, [[For a Leg]] that was infected, he became undead. He was murdered by [[Olsarthis|an assassin]] at the feasting after a succesful raid in an isle east of [[Molhorys]].
