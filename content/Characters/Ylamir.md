A [[Twilight Veil]] outcast and powerful wizard. This group of defectors was not compact. Each individual wizard had his own motivations, and ranked them very highly. This also applied to him, who disagreed with the reckless use of this magic and disliked mass slaughter at the village of [[Guldak]]. In secret, he visited [[Volanir]] and after telling the elves there what happened at [[Guldak]], confessed that they themselves would be the next target if they did not respond. While the elves initially suspected him and captured him, their scouts quickly confirmed his words. Indeed, the atrocities the renegades had committed had been learned, while they had summoned other [[Asura]] and were heading for [[Volanir]].

After he abandoned his outcast kin and forwarned the [[Daral]] elves of the coming invasion and their atrocities at [[Guldak]], the elves sent scouts. While the elves initially suspected him and captured him, their scouts quickly confirmed his words. Indeed, the atrocities the renegades had committed had been learned, while they had summoned other [[Asura]] and were heading for [[Volanir]].

The elves, pressed, conditionally freed Ylamir to help them. In a marsh before the forest, named [[Bladdar]], they gathered their forces and hid themselves, waiting for the army to appear. Their druids, aided by Ylamir, made the elves invisible: and the wizards with the Asura came dangerously close. By the time the first of them realized something was wrong, it was already too late: the cord had closed. The elves [[Bladdar Massacre|attacked]] from every direction, Ylamir had given them magic arrows that prevented the use of spells on anyone they nailed. A swarm of them fell upon the wizards, while wolf-shaped druids and armored warriors rushed to fight the Asura hand-to-hand. Ylamir wove deadly spells aimed at the strongest wizards, knowing their weaknesses all too well. Soon the attackers were found headless.

Most wizards were quickly put out of action, apart from a few who managed to use teleportation magic. But the Asura were many, and the losses of the elves were great. Ylamir quickly ran out of spells, and so did the druids, many of whom were badly wounded. [[Asura]] generally do not fear death and consider pain a pleasure, so they would fight to the death, at rates that quickly wore down even the bravest of warriors. Ylamir soon found himself trying to make arcane invocations to gain extra power, appealing to the [[Aspects]]. One by one they all ignored them, except for [[Fallfaunt]], who was far enough north to catch her attention. A Rusalka named [[Almefis]], her emissary, emerged from the waters and told him that she could help, but her intervention came at a cost. Ylamir hastily accepted it and she channeled her power through him.

He raised his hands and began chanting a powerful spell, his eyes turning blue. Frozen air rose up, and surrounded the entire satanic army. Within moments, all of them had turned into ice crystals, shattering as soon as the warriors hit them. The battle was over.

## Aftermath

Ylamir was deified by the elves and received into the city with all honors: He himself did not rest, however, for he knew that he must fulfill his debt to [[Fallfaunt]]. A week later, he returned to the battlefield, and began invoking necromantic spells. Soon, all the slain wizards and Asuras who had fallen there rose like undead, without will, and gathered around him.

In complete secrecy, Ylamir led them to [[Hoss]], with the help of [[Almefis]], who knew the places. They moved east, until he found a spot he liked, to build a tribute to the goddess: A castle in her name. All the undead went to work without interruption, and Ylamir used his spells to perfect their work. Stones, ices, crystals, topazes and emeralds were its basic materials. Arches and columns to enormous heights gradually formed, while some crystals were made of Almefis' spells.

It took a full decade to complete, but in the end [[Ylamir]] was satisfied with the result. He retired to his chambers with [[Almefis]], and named the palace Fol'rish, the White Wonder. It was then that Rusalka exacted the sorcerer's final debt: After taking his seed, she killed him and took his heart for [[Fallfaunt]]. He placed it in the center of the palace, and it began to glow with a blue light, as the heart had now become a mighty artifact with immense power. And Almefis became the castellan of Fol'rish, with the undead serving her, while nothing was ever learned about her child: though many believe she is the witch who started the [[Winter's War]].
