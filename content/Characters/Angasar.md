Former leader of the [[Erle]] Pack in [[Hoen]] that joined [[Tearthis]]. He was appointed the protector of [[Volsgon]] forest by the [[Tearthis]] archdruid [[Biragg]]. He defied [[Oliven]]'s recruits and they skirmished to settle the manner. He injured [[Petton]] during his intervention to protect [[Oliven]] but offered him healing berries after and they made amends.

He took [[Elbion]] as his apprentice.
