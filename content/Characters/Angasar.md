Former leader of the [[Erle]] Pack in [[Hoen]] that joined [[Tearthis]]. He was appointed the protector of [[Volsgon]] forest by the [[Tearthis]] archdruid [[Biragg]]. He defied [[Oliven]]'s recruits and they skirmished to settle the manner. He injured [[Petton]] during his intervention to protect [[Oliven]] but offered him healing berries after and they made amends.

He took [[Elbion]] as his apprentice.

## End of [[Feneg]] and [[Feren]]

With the help of [[Al]] and [[Oliven]], they performed a ceremony on the southern border of dragon [[Feneg]]'s territory, awakening the ancient dragon [[Feren]] â€” who until then everyone thought that he has traveled to another, unknown region - from his long sleep. A fierce and chaotic battle broke out. [[Oliven]] took on the mighty Feren who was stronger and angrier than ever, Angasar fought his firstborn son [[Feneg]] and [[Al]] along with an alchemist, an orc blacksmith, a priest and three guards kept his sister [[Faeg]] at a safe distance to not interfere with the ceremony. Angasar managed to kill Feneg using the help of trees and forest animals. Oliven unleashed a series of powerful lightning bolts that struck and seared the beast and with another lightning bolt at Faeg he knocked the two dragons to the floor, never to rise again.
