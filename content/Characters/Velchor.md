A legendary sage of the North that is well respected among giants and barbarian tribes. He is rumored to take several different forms and to travel constantly from village to village, spreading his wisdom and knowledge in a subtle way. Velchor was no stranger to danger. He had forged his own magical weapons, an ax and a spear, and his armor had many runic protections. His spells aided him in battle, and he could heal the wounds of the injured. He is rumored to be the one of the best living runecrafters and it is whispered he helped to make [[Torniv]].

## [[Elderom]] journey

[[Velchor]] the Bold did not flinch in the face of the unknown. Determined, he journeyed across the ice of [[Scalemist]], determined to find the truth.

The first few weeks found him traversing glaciers, icebergs and rocks: there he also fought an ancient dragon, [[Kladgarin]], in a battle that was heard as far as the Wolf's Mouth, where he forced him to flee after severely wounding him. He continued on the inhospitable paths of the north, until the glaciers gave way to white mountains, and the mountains to snowy forests. And then, Velchor was now sure he had crossed the ocean, and found land.

But he did not know exactly where he was as he continued his way south: Everything here seemed different, and the [[Aspects]] did not answer his call. Even [[Jalerk]], who accompanied him throughout his journey, was silent after a while. He did sacrifices and shouted, but no one seemed to be there. Even the vegetation was different: the trees were pale and poisonous and the sun's rays did not pass under their foliage. All the sounds he heard were unfamiliar. The creatures he found were unlike anything he knew: They obeyed no rules of symmetry or harmony. They had a random number of limbs, eyes and claws. Even within the same species there were huge differences.

He was often forced to fight and ward off these strange and disgusting creatures on a daily basis. The danger seemed to be ever increasing, and it was evident that the place did not welcome outsiders. But Velchor was no stranger to danger. He had forged his own magical weapons, an ax and a spear, and his armor had many runic protections. His spells aided him in battle, and he could heal his wounds, and ignore the madness the place caused him. After many days and battles, he reached a point where the very ground seemed to vibrate with an unknown energy. Tentacles and monsters came out from everywhere to attack him, but he could fight for hours without stopping. Enemies abounded, and appeared in every conceivable size and shape.

Velchor soon realized that even he could not fight there forever. He feared that he would die without even understanding where he is, what this place is, and what these creatures are. Then he took out of his knapsack a stone which he had taken with him as a charm from [[Thunder Mountain]]. He drew runes down and began to call upon mighty [[Vethians]] to aid him from [[Zinctizuctra]]. These created a defensive circle around him as he began to call the power of Veth into the stone. As soon as the ceremony was over, the Vethians simultaneously fell down dead and the stone absorbed their souls, and began to glow a crimson color, filled with letters in ancient languages.

Then, the land itself seemed to rise up to attack Velchor. He was surely doomed, as he had no magic power left, and he couldn't even stand up from exhaustion. With all the strength he had left, he lifted the stone up, and it glowed crimson. Velchor was blinded by the light and there was a thunder that hit him. He fell down unconscious.

When he regained consciousness, there was silence all around him. There was not a single tentacle left, no blood down there, but his own. Then he found that he was all alone in the forest, and the battle was witnessed only by some trees, which were broken and marks on the ground from dug earth. The forest looked normal, albeit empty. It was obvious now that he had fought one of [[Yast]]'s higher servants: Creatures without a name, who try to cross over into the [[Material Plane]] to destroy it.

Many believe that this fact was the main reason Velchor is counted among the Five Sages. Among them, he is certainly the least educated and the most uncivilized. He is still prone to his violent tendencies and finds it almost impossible to trust anyone or make friends. He is, however, the only one who has seen with his own eyes the embodiment of Yast, the absolute void, and has not only survived, but can speak coolly about this experience.
