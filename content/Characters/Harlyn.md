A [[Green Hills]]n traitor that kidnapped with help from pirates the brother of [[Green Hills]]' king, [[Erdin]], in [[Sinaxon]] island. He was thrown to prison by Lord [[Thallior]] after [[Erdin]] died in mysterious circumstances. He was accused of being related to Imtaria and being an double agent, they accused the king that he shouldn't trusted him, and they believed that Erdin died because he was a staunch opponent of the alliance with Imtaria and the disastrous campaign in Paraselt. The three trackers were ultimately acquitted of all charges. However, a few days later, Harlyn disappeared from the prison, and all of his guards were murdered in the night.
