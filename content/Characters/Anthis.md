An ambitious and careless [[Demonslaver]] wizard and apprentice of [[Lodern]]. He is widely believed to be responsible for the creation of a [[Portal]] that called uncontrolled forces of [[demons]] from the [[Abyss]] and subsequently destroyed and ravaged half of the island of [[Olgizmar]].

The younger brother of the elf [[Queen Taniel]] of the [[Green Hills]]. Anthis had been exiled because the magic he used, the summoning of demons, was forbidden in the Green Hills, and he had found refuge in Olgizmar, then Almahr. Gradually he was able to come into contact with a powerful demon named [[Knaridzna]]: A four-legged huge beast that had thousands of warriors under its command. This of course was something Anthis was unaware of as he was ecstatic at his feat. She continued to call on him more and more often, and he took every opportunity to learn the Pyrlon area and the city's outskirts.

One day, Anthis had arranged a demonstration for other archmages of the [[Demonslavers]] and they had gathered at [[Pyrlon]]'s summoning tower. Properly prepared, Anthis opened a great [[Portal]] to the Abyss, through which Knaridzna passed, who bowed to the haughty mages, who were impressed with the demonic general's power. Their surprise was even greater when another serpentine form emerged from the gate, a powerful demoness brandishing jatagans and shields in her six arms. Then an older mage, [[Lodern]], turned to Anthis and asked if the situation was under control.

The answer came both from Anthis's bewilderment, not expecting another to appear, and from a third, flaming figure appearing at the Gate. The result was beyond Anthis's expectations, precisely because the demons had tricked him and used his own spells to get through the gate and break through the arrogant mage's protections. [[Lodern]] was the only mage who managed to teleport away, as he had left his arcane mark for safety reasons: The others watched in awe as Knaridzna slammed his lance down and a field appeared that momentarily broke the concentration of those mages who began chanting spells.
