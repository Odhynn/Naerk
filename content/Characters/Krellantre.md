After the defeat, she sought refuge in [[Str√ºmeld]] and swore allegiance to [[Dumspergrond]]. In [[War of the Titan]], she attacked the village of [[Northwind]] and destroyed it, killing and torturing hundreds of villagers. She and her war party was slain after a vicious battle by the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]].
