Daughter of [[Feren]]. After the mid-fifth millennium, she stayed at her father's region that was ruled by her older brother [[Feneg]]. The [[Dragonpact]] didn't like this at all as they feared on the one hand the consequences of a fight between two dragons living in the same space, while on the other hand that they would start claiming more space because there were two of them. After a seemingly fruitless negotiation and on the verge of a pitched battle, a threat from Feneg paid off. _"If we start losing we'll leave and burn any town we find vulnerable, and leave again, and burn again—again and again—but you'll have won and I'd love to see you brag about how well the Dragonpact, about how he managed to drive two dragons away from where they weren't bothering anyone - so that we wouldn't burn the forest one day fighting, as you foretold we would - and the only cost was that they burned a few cities before they were found. And I wonder how soon will you and your [[Akerosoth]] hounds find us."_ He said addressing the dragon-agent of the Dragonpact. After this Akerosoth ordered the Dragonpact to retreat and the two dragons continued to rule the forest and prey on passersby.

In the spring of the year 4818, not even half a month after the birth of her son [[Efren]], [[Angasar]], [[Oliven]], and [[Al]] the Seer found themselves performing a ceremony on the southern border of their territory, awakening her father [[Feren]] — who until then everyone thought that he has traveled to another, unknown region - from his long sleep. A fierce and chaotic battle broke out. [[Oliven]] took on the mighty Feren who was stronger and angrier than ever, Angasar fought his firstborn son [[Feneg]] and [[Al]] along with an alchemist, an orc blacksmith, a priest and three guards kept [[Faeg]] at a safe distance to not interfere with the ceremony. Angasar managed to kill Feneg using the help of trees and forest animals. Oliven unleashed a series of powerful lightning bolts that struck and seared the beast and with another lightning bolt at Faeg he knocked the two dragons to the floor, never to rise again.

In that cursed day, she had lost her father and grandfather, while her baby [[Efren]] was incapacitated.
