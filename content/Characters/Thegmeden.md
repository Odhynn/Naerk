A small, shadowy and murderous demon believed by many to be the most sadistic amongst the [[Vile Septet]]. He relished in torture and assassinations during [[Pyrlon Carnage]] and took the eastern shores next to the forests, which became known as the [[Frostrifts]], vast expanses of unnatural red ice and undead that seemed to have emerged from [[Styx]].

In the [[Bloodline War]], he faced the front guard of the faithful counterattack and managed to hold a line at the beach. Casualties were huge on both sides, but eventually he managed to trap [[La-Vermenel]] with a shadow net and then [[Knaridzna]] executed her. This caused a massive explosion that annihilated half of his forces and left Thegmeden's face and body deeply burned.
