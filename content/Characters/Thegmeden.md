A small, shadowy and murderous demon believed by many to be the most sadistic amongst the [[Vile Septet]]. He relished in torture and assassinations during [[Pyrlon Carnage]] and took the eastern shores next to the forests, which became known as the [[Frostrifts]], vast expanses of unnatural red ice and undead that seemed to have emerged from [[Styx]].
