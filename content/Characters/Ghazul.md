A loyal crewmate of captain [[Fellan]] that died in 4812 during captain [[Valus]]' attack on [[Molhorys]]. A few years later, when his fellow pirates once again plundered these shores, they raised him as an undead skeleton and he returned to [[Genie Soul]]. Shortly after, captain [[Fellan]] was murdered and he took upon his shoulders to be the captain of the ship.
