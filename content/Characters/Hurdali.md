 Hurdali Khamarnaya is a Viperfolk alchemist that came from [[Ngamui Isles]], and soon gained a reputation as the most lethal poisoner in all of [[South Darrok]]: His toxins were deadly in a variety of ways. Some hypnotized, some paralyzed, some killed slowly and some quickly. And apparently no evidence ever came back to him, as he also kept a low profile. Frowned member of the [[Khalarsnake]].
