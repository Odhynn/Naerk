## Description

The king of the giant seat in [[Tronerdim]], he was a powerful sorcerer and a keen learner of ancient texts. He was the father of [[Skalindrosh]] and [[Gorstein]]. He wielded [[Storm Spear]].

## History

He accepted [[Karahath]]'s call to arms and treaty and joined forces against [[Imtaria]]. His motives were unclear, but he contributed with two hundred giants to [[Defeated Army|the army]]. He disappeared during [[Battle of Fherlon Plains]] after a colossal thunderstrike that inflicted huge casualties on both sides. Without leadership, his forces joined [[Hoberkorra]]'s trolls and smashed enemy cavalry that chased the retreat. The majority of his giants journeyed back to [[Hoen]] and the [[Storm Spear]] was returned to Tronerdim.
