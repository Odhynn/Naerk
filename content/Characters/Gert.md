A frost giant leader from [[Tronerdim]] that overheard [[Dalvuigg]]'s stories about [[Korhond]]'s riches and decided to assemble a strike force and invade west. This led to [[Battle of Norleg Cross]] and his subsequent duel with [[Dalvuigg]], whom he thought an easy opponent. He eventually lost the duel and was forced to leave in peace.
