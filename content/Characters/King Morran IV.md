A famously greedy king and knight of [[Green Hills]] that was invaded by the armies of [[Karahath]]. He asked [[Emperor Ilarein]]'s help as he was afraid of the sheer size of the [[Kambah]] forces. During the [[Battle of Fherlon Plains]], he led the forces of [[Petch-cro-Bor]] to a trap and after heavy losses from both sides he led a cataphract charge against the orc forces. He killed the orc warlord but was severely injured by his serrated blade. After two weeks of agonising pain and the failed treatments of [[Factar]] healers, he died.
