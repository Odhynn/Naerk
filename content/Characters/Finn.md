The daughter of [[Yøll]] Serok, she fled [[Thimvert Reach]] and fought at [[Winter's War]] and [[Totem War]]. She was legendary for her skill in throwing axes, the mighty [[Shatterwinds]] that [[Klont]] crafted for her. She married a northman, Timber and stayed for several years in [[Korhond]], giving birth to a son, [[Oleg]]. She returned decades later with her people in Thimvert to establish their ancestral home from the start. She rebult their ancestral home and lived to the venerable age of 118.
