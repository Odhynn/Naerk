A fey ruler, appointed by the witch hag [[Tikimura]] during [[The Blaburry Expansion]] to help the forests' defence. She utilised nature magic to protect the forest until the [[Bloodscale]] intervened with the help of a traitor fey, [[Flux]]. They disrupted her with rituals from within her territory, from [[Flux]]'s cave. She realised this interference and assaulted the cave with [[Tikimura]]. They killed most [[Bloodscale]] and lizardfolk, as well as the mighty dragon [[Alfavriix]] and saved the forest by restoring nature's balance. Still, she was captured with many other fey by [[Ozrallon]], [[Alfavriix]]'s son, and tortured for many decades.

Many decades after, in 4818, a group of travelers found Ozrallon's lair. Once Flux told them what happened, they attacked the lizardmen, freed Valauri, and with her help killed Ozrallon and took [[Tikimura]] to the Evergrowing Forest for her final resting place. The temple was destroyed and Valauri restored the nature to the area and forgave [[Flux]] for his betrayal.
