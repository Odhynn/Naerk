A cunning demon general that followed after [[Knaridzna]] through the Pyrlon Gate on the day of [[Pyrlon Carnage]]. She was an ally of [[Knaridzna]] and tried to see the big picture beyond the carnage. She stayed at [[Pyrlon]] and ruled the city with [[Molroth]].

As a strategist, she played a crucial role in the conquest of [[Olgizmar]] and the [[Bloodline War]], as she commanded the siege of [[Lamerpad]]. When she learned of the [[Darrok]] counterattack plan, she orchestrated a huge trap that involved flooding of the [[Bloodline]] and cutting off the frontguard. At the most critical moment of the battle, with most [[Nahema]] clerics exhausted with most of their divine power spent. She sent flying beasts that descended upon the priests, and armored demon soldiers filled the gaps in the hills' defenses. She attacked and slaughtered [[Taira]], who was locked in battle with [[Knaridzna]]'s bodyguard. Demons surrounded the believers from every possible direction and were decimating them.
