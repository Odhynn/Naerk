The son of [[Dimma]], grandson of [[Aegir]] and father of [[Knut]] Granitson, his adventurous life is described in [[The Saga of Granit, The Bastard of the North]]. He tempered the [[Aspects]], especially [[Crel'vach]], with his actions and was punished with eternal attempts to try and perform his boastings.
