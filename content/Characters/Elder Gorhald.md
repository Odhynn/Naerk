The venerable ex-leader of the [[Dal'Vorag]] tribe and father of [[Maul]], [[Pineg]] and [[Hramm]].

## Prophecy of his successor

One day, an orc prophet told him that whoever brought the legendary skull of their tribe's founder, [[Grimson]] back to the tribe would become its greatest leader. Gorhald didn't care about the prophecy, since he was already a leader and had nothing to prove to anyone. But the time came when his sons, [[Pineg]], [[Maul]] and [[Hramm]] grew up and began to claim the leadership, while they began to become jealous and hostile among themselves.

One night, Gorhald called them to his tent. He told them the story of [[Grimson]], and that whoever brought him the skull would become chief of the clan in his place. The three brothers lost no opportunity to prove their worth and take command of the tribe, and next morning they prepared to leave for [[Legthir Pass]]. [[Koldrag]], a distant descendant of Grimson, led them to the pass after a long journey.

One of them returned, frostbiten and bruised: [[Maul]], with the skull of [[Grimson]] in his hand and claimed leadership, so Gorhald stepped aside.
