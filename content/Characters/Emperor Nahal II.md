One of the longest-reign emperors of [[Imtaria]]. He was overprotective of his daughters, especially [[Empress Oscia II|Oscia]]. It is believed that during his reign, an aristocracy circle was developed that was completely corrupted and disconnected from the needs of [[Imtaria]] and only cared for wealth, tournaments and parties.

When his eldest daughter renounced her inheritance and crown and disappeared, Nahal moved heaven and earth to find her. With the help of [[Nahema]]'s priests, he was able to learn that she was somewhere in [[Athalahr]], a region far in the northwest that until then little was known about. Even the most powerful divination spells could not find her. The emperor, well into his nineties, took five ships and set sail to find her. The ships and the emperor never returned. Most of his advisors said that they were not enough. All the magicians and priests who tried to find out what happened failed miserably. Another expedition of ten ships was sent, but it returned fruitless, citing fog and bad weather.
