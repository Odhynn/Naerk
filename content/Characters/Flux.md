A tiny fey that betrayed the defending forces during [[The Blaburry Expansion]]. He had given up its cave on the coast to [[Klemnestron]]'s followers after their threats. There they began to perform ceremonies to strengthen the [[Bloodscale]] warriors and weaken the power of [[Queen Valauri]] over the local flora and fauna. Valauri understood that this magical intervention began in her own area, but in order for it to be successful, the invitation of one of the locals was necessary. She begged her warriors, even at the last moment, for whoever was to blame to admit it and save the forest. Guilty from his remorse, Flux admitted it, and Valauri cursed him to enjoy nothing until they recaptured the temple.

Decades Later [[Queen Valauri]] forgave him of his betrayal after he helped a group of travellers free her.
