*Burning Rage*
An ancient wyrm that ruled [[Kegrozal]] and defied [[Dragonpact]]. Father of [[Emberspark]]. He allied himself with [[Bloodscale]] troops. He knew the elder salamander [[Innorf]] and when asked about her by the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]], he also told [[Bloodscale]] troops to attack them, resulting in the death of [[Aldastrio]]. He died while he sieged the [[Yerastu]] temple of [[Ilistair]] by the aspect of the powerful champion [[Hikari]] channeled through [[Shizu]], his ancestor.
