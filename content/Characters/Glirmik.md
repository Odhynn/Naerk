The disgusting son of [[Dumspergrond]] that was called by his father to fight in the [[War of the Titan]]. From an underground passage in [[Styx]] he brought a small group of [[Erevi]], who were used as scouts, spies and informers. During the [[War of the Titan]] he helped [[Hossoth]] and afterwards [[Krellantre]] in the razing of [[Northwind]] village. He adviced her for caution, but her fomorian force aimlessly burned and looted, unorganised, and was attacked and destroyed by [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]]. When she was slain, he teleported to safety.
