Ex-King of [[Whistor]]
Trifling Conqueror
Paranoid

## The Prophecy

_"Know this, O great king: Your reign will end quickly. Your popularity will plummet. Your sons and wife will be buried by you, and of your inheritance soon nothing will remain. Your palace will be sacked. Your years are numbered, your days of happiness are coming to an end, and your dead body will rot under the sun."_

These were the words of the Oracle. It was one of the few times Mantissa answered without hints, riddles, or half-wits: And King Raldon had purposely made the journey to the [[Four Winds Monastery|monastery of the Four Winds]] to hear her words in person: For there was not one of his subjects who could absolute certainty and confidence to convey to him exactly the words of the fortune-teller. Most people would be afraid to push their luck, as Raldon, although calm, had occasional fits of rage, especially when he heard bad news.

Perhaps that was the reason why the Oracle spoke to him with such directness. Precisely because he probably appreciated that he came himself: Perhaps, some will say, because he knew deep down what he was going to hear. During the twenty years of his reign, from the year 4752, his course was only upward. Whistor's army had tripled in size, the population of the island's cities had grown rapidly, and the country had become a trading center for all the South Sea. When he passed through the streets, he needed no escort: the locals hugged him and cheered as he passed.

## Paranoia

When Raldon returned to the island, he significantly reduced his public appearances. Unlike others who had received fateful prophecies, Raldon accepted it fully. He knew what was the fate of those who tried to avoid their fate: But he himself chose another path. He strengthened his navy and his army, but remained silent.

By this time, the [[Pirate Council]] had begun to look westward. The first attacks were on the commercial road to [[St. Qurin]]: And soon, one in four ships was facing attacks and looting. Raldon did not sit idly by. His fleet consisted of many hundreds of ships and experienced warriors. In the first three naval battles the [[Whistor Pirate Hunt]]chased the pirates to the [[Ngamui Isles]], his victories being overwhelming. For every galley lost, the pirates lost twenty-seven times as many schooners and ships.

The pirates quickly fled in the face of constant danger of overwhelming defeat, while [[Whistor]]'s galleys soon accompanied all major trade routes. Raldon took an active part in all the naval battles with his flagship and his two sons, but no part of the prophecy seemed to be fulfilled. Raldon soon found that the pirates avoided engaging him in head-to-head combat, as his fleet was superior. But he feared that they might ambush him in some narrow passage, and he believed in his paranoia that sooner or later they would find a way to avenge him.

After a while, he realised that the only thing that could be misinterpreted by the prophecy's doom was his country. Had he made his personal sacrifices, Whistor's power might not have been lost: with another strong leadership, he might perhaps have preserved his former greatness: he himself would not have lived to see it, but his efforts so many years in recruiting, in works, taxation and trade they would not go to waste.

And the only way to ensure this was through his own betrayal of his people. He took three ships, filled with his most trusted warriors and his captain's sons, and met the pirates. And then he made an agreement for a truce: and in order for the pirates might accept it, he gave them his sons as sureties for the cessation of hostilities on his part, and they in turn gave him a captain who was a member of their Council: A Fiendfolk named [[Della]], who was particularly crafty.

Rumors soon spread throughout the army: That [[Raldon]] had made an underground alliance with the pirates, and that he had betrayed his kingdom for a woman. But the attacks of the pirates stopped: Although the people began to believe that in addition to his sons, the pirates also demanded a huge amount of money from him: An amount that, many believed, he agreed to give at regular intervals as a tribute.

Things got even worse when, a few days after his return to his palace, his wife, who was particularly beloved by the people, was found poisoned. No one was sure how it happened, but all suspicion went to Della's face. Many began to spread the word that she had seduced the king and made him fall asleep. The king's generals called the people for a coup: they entered the palace after the funeral and threw Raldon and Della into the dungeons. Whistor's commander-in-chief, named [[Kuthnor]], assumed the kingship temporarily.
