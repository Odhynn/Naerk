The lord governor of [[Tas-Roch]] that was manipulated by the witch [[Angariel]] into giving the werewolves the lower part of the city during the [[Werewolf Siege]]. He was heavily criticised by his people and many wanted him removed from his seat. Riots broke into the city but when the potion Angariel made to help the werewolves control their transformation caused several unexpected and violent results and the werewolves were unable to mount an attack on the inner walls. Slagis issued a public proclamation saying that the witch had betrayed his trust and that she had run away as a wanted woman.
