Lady Shizu Kashiwa (Kashiwa O-Shizu in Yuuyamii/Sennarii, and commonly known as the Swordmaiden Serene in Naerk) was a swordmaster from the Realms Beyond who travelled through Naerk in 4776-4778 as a member of the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]], an adventuring party that was at the forefront of events such as the [[Battle of Fellgaunt]], the dragon [[Solusmeir]]'s attack on [[Ilistair]], the [[War of the Titan]], and the reclamation of the chthonic artifact [[Rod of Stone and Steel]].

She arrived to Naerk through the Athalaari skyportals as a political refugee after her school's defeat during civil strife in her homeland of Yuuyami, and took to referring to herself as "Shizu the Swordmaiden" in her subsequent travels, as by Yuuyamii culture a *rounin* (lordless *bushi*) has no right to a clan name.

In her quests with the Band of Blood and Brimstone, she became a wielder of [[Shiji-Sha]], a Knight-Protector of the [[Ironglance]] Order, and the slayer of the titan [[Dumspergrond]]. She is also regarded as a progenitor of the Sennarii nation for her role in [[Sennarin#the Arrival]].

## Backstory

Shizu was born in 1352 (Realms Calendar) in the village of Shinizumi on Torajima, one of the supervolcanic isles of Yuuyami in the Realms Beyond, to the Kashiwa jizamurai[^2] clan. Her paternal grandfather and patriarch of the clan, Shoujirou Kashiwa, was

Shoujirou came from a long line of holy warriors descending from [[Hikari]] Kashiwa, who had travelled in Naerk himself three millenia ago, through the astral portals in Shikyoujin, the giant crater island at the centre of the Yuuyamii caldera, and remained there hence.

She was the eldest of four children, and would often find herself at the head of the household when their parents were away in army expeditions. During such times, she, her little brother Kenjirou and twin sisters Hime and Sen, would be taken care of by their grandfather, Shoujirou Kashiwa.

## Legacy

Having become incredibly powerful in her own right, she afterwards returned to the Realms Beyond to reckon with the forces that had expelled her thence. A series of events that also transpired between the two worlds and included the [[Swords of the Archangels| Dawnblade]] led to her ascent to angelic power there.

The Realms Beyond suffered an apocalyptic event soon after that rent the very fabric of magic. The resulting cosmic instability awoke the supervolcano that had birthed the islands of Yuuyami.

Sensing Yuuyami's impending doom, Shizu returned there in angelic form and rallied the people to head straight to Shikyoujin, wherein lied the skyportal to Naerk that she had also once escaped through.
Most of the population refused to sail into the maws of the awoken smoking volcano, however there were several thousand who did so, trusting her word; they mostly came from her native island of Torajima.

Using her newfound divine power, she completed the reconstruction of the sky tower there, destroyed a few years ago by [[Jeanne Claire Lillith]] and [[Griannimhziel]] in their own passing into Naerk.
She bade farewell to her little twin sisters, Hime and Sen, passing on [[Shiji-Sha]] to Hime, and opened the astral passage for her people to escape through. Shortly after their flight, the supervolcano consumed itself in a massive chain of eruptions, and Yuuyami was no more.

The Yuuyamii refugees of that disasters flew through the void, around the Cosmodrome and into Edhailin in the event known as [[Sennarin#the Arrival]], and are thenceforth known as the Sennarii.
The Lady of the Lake held the portal open for them to pass through on orders by Angaeradh[^3], at the cost of her life and the portal itself. The Sennarii revered her after this sacrifice, directly influencing her rise to divinity as [[Lleyn]].
Shizu and Lleyn are hence often revered jointly as the *Seitorii-no-Tenshi* (Angels of the Star Gates), *Shizukagami-sama* and *Tsukizumigami-sama* respectively.

[^1]: When young Shizu's master Toshizou Shirokuma was departing Gokumon Castle for that fateful Lords' Assembly, she asked him for the reason the school had to be involved in the civil strife; he replied with this verse. This ended up being his last words and lesson to her, and she kept it as her primary mantra. After she returned to the Realms Beyond, it resonated well with the Rosewood Harpers, and was in turn picked up by their progeny who now wander Naerk with it engraved on their Swords of the Everbright.
[^2]: A lower warrior cast of provincial _bushi_ who tended to be farmers and craftsmen rather than bureaucrats, and would fill the non-commissioned officer ranks in times of war. Their hardy lifestyle generally made them more skilled in arms and not as prone to the complacency displayed by the upper warrior class.
[^3]: Torajima had a large elven population, and most of them heeded Shizu's call. Angaeradh had foreseen this, and saw it as the long-awaited return of the elves to Athalaar.
