Lady Shizu Kashiwa, commonly known as Shizu the Swordmaiden, was a swordmaster from the Realms Beyond who travelled through Naerk in 4776-4778 as a member of the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]], an adventuring party that was at the forefront of such events as the [[Battle of Fellgaunt]], the dragon [[Solusmeir]]'s attack on [[Ilistair]], the [[War of the Titan]], and the reclamation of the chthonic artifact [[Rod of Stone and Steel]].

She was a wielder of [[Shiji-Sha]], a Knight-Protector of the [[Ironglance]] Order, and slayer of the titan [[Dumspergrond]].

## Backstory

Kashiwa O-Shizu was born in 1352 (Realms Calendar) in the village of Shinizumi on Torajima, one of the supervolcanic isles of Yuuyami in the Realms Beyond, to the Kashiwa jizamurai[^2] clan.

She was the eldest of four children, and would often find herself at the head of the household when their parents were away in army expeditions. During such times, she, her little brother Kenjirou and twin sisters Hime and Sen, would be taken care of by their grandfather, Shoujirou Kashiwa.
Shoujirou came from a long line of holy warriors descending from [[Hikari]], who had ended up in Naerk himself three millenia ago


[^1]: When young Shizu's master Toshizou Shirokuma was departing Harukyuuden Castle for that fateful Lords' Assembly, she asked him for the reason the school had to be involved in the civil strife; he replied with this verse. This ended up being his last words and lesson to her, and she kept it as her primary mantra. After she returned to the Realms Beyond, it resonated well with the Rosewood Harpers, and was in turn picked up by their progeny who now wander Naerk with it engraved on their Swords of the Everbright.
[^2]: A lower warrior cast of provincial _bushi_ who tended to be farmers and craftsmen rather than bureaucrats, and would fill the non-commissioned officer ranks in times of war. Their hardy lifestyle generally made them more skilled in arms and not as prone to the complacency displayed by the upper warrior class.
