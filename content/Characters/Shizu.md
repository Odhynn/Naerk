Lady Shizu Kashiwa (Kashiwa O-Shizu in Yuuyamii/Sennarii, commonly known as the Swordmaiden Serene in Naerk) was a swordmaster from the Realms Beyond who travelled through Naerk in 4776-4778 as a member of the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]] an adventuring party that was at the forefront of events such as the [[Battle of Fellgaunt]], the dragon [[Solusmeir]]'s attack on [[Ilistair]], the [[War of the Titan]], and the reclamation of the chthonic artifact [[Rod of Stone and Steel]].

She arrived to Naerk through the Athalaari skyportals as a political refugee after her school's defeat during civil strife in her homeland of Yuuyami, and took to referring to herself as "Shizu the Swordmaiden" in her subsequent travels, as by Yuuyamii culture a *rounin* (lordless *bushi*) has no right to a clan name.

In her quests with the Band of Blood and Brimstone, she became a wielder of [[Shiji-Sha]], a Knight-Protector of the [[Ironglance]] Order, and the slayer of the titan [[Dumspergrond]]. She is also regarded as a progenitor of the Sennarii nation for her role in [[Sennarin#the Arrival]].

## Backstory

Shizu was born in 1352 (Realms Calendar) in the village of Shinizumi on Torajima, one of the supervolcanic isles of Yuuyami in the Realms Beyond, to the Kashiwa jizamurai[^2] clan.

She was the eldest of four children, and would often find herself at the head of the household when their parents were away in army expeditions. During such times, she, her little brother Kenjirou and twin sisters Hime and Sen, would be taken care of by their grandfather, Shoujirou Kashiwa.
Shoujirou came from a long line of holy warriors descending from [[Hikari]], who had ended up in Naerk himself three millenia ago


## Legacy

Having become incredibly powerful in her own right, she afterwards returned to the Realms Beyond to reckon with the forces that had expelled her thence. A series of events that also transpired between the two worlds and included the [[Swords of the Archangels| Dawnblade]] led to her ascent to angelic power there. The Realms Beyond suffered an apocalyptic event soon after that led to the destruction of Yuuyami and the flight of its people, aided by her intervention, through the Athalaari skyportals into Naerk; these Yuuyami rean event known as the arrival


[^1]: When young Shizu's master Toshizou Shirokuma was departing Harukyuuden Castle for that fateful Lords' Assembly, she asked him for the reason the school had to be involved in the civil strife; he replied with this verse. This ended up being his last words and lesson to her, and she kept it as her primary mantra. After she returned to the Realms Beyond, it resonated well with the Rosewood Harpers, and was in turn picked up by their progeny who now wander Naerk with it engraved on their Swords of the Everbright.
[^2]: A lower warrior cast of provincial _bushi_ who tended to be farmers and craftsmen rather than bureaucrats, and would fill the non-commissioned officer ranks in times of war. Their hardy lifestyle generally made them more skilled in arms and not as prone to the complacency displayed by the upper warrior class.
