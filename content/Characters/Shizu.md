>Pacing slowly backwards with her shield arm loose, she crossed the gate's threshold as the defendants of the [[Four Winds Monastery]] pulled the groaning levers to shut it after her.
>Upon her last glimpses of the place where [[Domovoi]]'s fallen form had finally crumpled to ruin, she held aloft her sword at the forehead. And there she stood in salute, she stood in silence, until the closing doors separated her gaze from the clouds in the distance bathed in blood, and the gate descended shut once more.
>She turned to face her remaining companions, their faces also grim in untold farewells.
>Shizu lay her shield to rest upon her leg as she sheathed her blade. It was the first time they'd seen this shield. It definitely was not her style, though the effect to which it had been used was not unlike her. The angel standing proudly upon its surface was now dented with dozens of arrow marks.
>The strong winds howling outside were merely turned into breezes flowing inside the walls of the monastery. And yet it seemed, they still blew strong around Shizu, her cloak billowing and her hair still dancing around her bloody bowed head, ever vibrant.
