Lady Shizu Kashiwa (Kashiwa O-Shizu in Yuuyamii/Sennarii, and commonly known as the Swordmaiden Serene in Naerk) was a swordmaster from the Realms Beyond who travelled through Naerk in 4776-4778 as a member of the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]], an adventuring party that was at the forefront of events such as the [[Battle of Fellgaunt]], the dragon [[Solusmeir]]'s attack on [[Ilistair]], the [[War of the Titan]], and the reclamation of the chthonic artifact [[Rod of Stone and Steel]].

She arrived to Naerk through the Athalaari skyportals as a political refugee after her school's defeat during civil strife in her homeland of Yuuyami, and took to referring to herself as "Shizu the Swordmaiden" in her subsequent travels, as by Yuuyamii culture a *rounin* (lordless *bushi*) has no right to a clan name.

In her quests with the Band of Blood and Brimstone, she became a wielder of [[Shiji-Sha]], a Knight-Protector of the [[Ironglance]] Order, and the slayer of the titan [[Dumspergrond]]. She is also regarded as a progenitor of the Sennarii nation for her role in [[Sennarin#the Arrival]].

## Origin

Shizu was born in 1352 (Realms Calendar) to Kenjirou Kashiwa and Akayama-no-Yuuki, in the village of Shinizumi on Torajima, one of the supervolcanic isles of Yuuyami in the Realms Beyond. Her paternal grandfather and patriarch of the Kashiwa jizamurai[^2] clan, Heisuke Kashiwa, was steward of the summit shrine on Mt. Akayama. 

![[../img/Yuuyami.jpg]]

A winged priest of Hogojin (the local guardian deity), Heisuke came from a long line of holy warriors descending from [[Hikari]] Kashiwa, who had travelled in Naerk three millenia ago through the astral portals in Shikyoujin (the giant crater island at the centre of the Yuuyamii caldera) and remained there hence as a high priest of [[Yerastu]].

Shizu was the eldest of four children, and would often find herself at the head of the household when their parents were away in army expeditions. During such times, she, her little brother Soujirou and twin sisters Hime and Sen, would be taken care of by their grandfather Heisuke.[^3]
When she was 12, she waited by the docks of Harukyuuden harbour as the expedition ships returned, to welcome her parents home, only to see her father come ashore alone.

She took up the sword soon after, enrolling into the Kagami Ittou Ryu school of swordsmanship, under the tutelage of master Toshizou Shirokuma. The dojo was part of a martial arts academy housed in Gokumon-jou, a castle perched on a rocky hill in Harukyuuden, capital of Torajima Isle.
Her dedication and skill saw her become first among the students and assistant master of the school, which focused on wielding a single katana in a left-forehand grip[^4].

### Fall of Gokumon Castle

When she was nineteen, the isles were embroiled in civil strife brought upon by the feuding of warlords and generals after the Yuuyami Marshal's passing. The martial grandmasters of Gokumon-jou, though not technically holding any kind of military rank or lordship, still held powerful sway in the political sphere and were popular with the common folk, and thus decided to take a stance, in line with the noble spirit of the academy.
When the discord was reaching a breaking point, they were invited to a Lords' Assembly that was meant to prevent the breakout of a civil war. The opposing side took this as an opportunity to isolate and murder them, then mobilised their troops to seize Gokumon Castle once the grandmasters were dead.

![[../img/Shizu-Gokumon.jpg]]

Back in the castle, Shizu and the other leading students decided to honour their masters and the castle academy by defending it to their last. As a full-blown coup d'etat took place and skirmishes erupted in the streets of Haruykyuuden, Gokumon Castle became the rallying point and finally, the last stand of the popular resistance. At the end of a two-day siege, the troops of the Three Generals stormed it and slaughtered its remaining defenders, mostly young adults and teens; this was lamented as the Night of the Young.
Having survived the fall of the castle among the girls taken captive, Shizu was rescued before dawn by her grandfather Heisuke who swooped in, killed her captors and took flight with her in his arms.

In the aftermath, the now ruling Three Generals decreed that to avoid further bloodshed, everyone who had taken up arms against them would be allowed to go into exile. Heisuke however knew that their ships were patrolling the outward sea, to ensure such exiles never reached the mainland alive, so he led Shizu and a group of other political refugees inward, to Shikyoujin. Using the same astral passage his ancestors once had travelled through, they escaped through the cosmic void to Naerk, finding themselves washing out of [[Edhailin]].

### Blood Moon

Their arduous journey through the wilderness took them to BjÃ¥glant, where they boarded a longship eastward. Misfortune had it that the Bloodmoon was nigh; its currents took hold of the ship and wrecked it on the shores of [[Selanaar]]. Dispersed along the woods and cliffs and struggling to regroup while battling oni and ancient demons through the haunted Selanahri cities, the Yuuyami group was decimated.
Mortally wounded, Heisuke bequeathed an inert [[Shiji-Sha]] to Shizu with his dying breath.

The sole survivor of the political refugees, Shizu trudged on alone until she met two other accidental castaways from the Realms Beyond, two rangers who had trailed a suspicious archmage far too deep, and together they made their way to the summit of Eltirion. There, the astral tower's keeper, [[Angaeradh|the Prophetess Under the Mountain]], agreed to send the two rangers back to the Realms Beyond if Shizu would acquiesce to stay in Naerk for two years, for she had foreseen great destiny awaiting the swordmaiden in Naerk.

> You are the Angel of Death, O-Shizu. Your story lies here; you may never walk out of your own story.[^5]
> _-- Angaeradh_

Traumatised as she was from her recent ordeals, in great shame and sorrow, Shizu had no intention of going back home anyway. From the fall of her dojo to the deaths of her grandfather and fellow refugees, she had endured much and managed to save noone but herself; thus she vowed to not return until she was strong enough, and asked to be shown the way to her destiny.
Elated, Angaeradh called forth the Boneship and bade its crew to ferry Shizu across the world to the Flame Gulf.[^6]

## Band of Blood and Brimstone
Shizu arrived in Erstal with nothing but a backpack, a leather armour, and her grandfather's sword.
Turning around a corner in the streets, Shizu bumped into a young elf earth-wizard by the name of [[Aldastrio]]. The exploits of the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]] began with them clearing kobold infestations and guarding caravans heading westward across the desert.
On a brief trip through the Underdark, they scuffled with a band of orcs whereupon [[Domovoi]] the Reaper swung his scythe an inch apart from Shizu's eyes before deciding to slaughter his kinsmen and join the party instead.

As they journeyed on through the sandy wastelands on the way to Hoarinhel, Shizu was informed by a spirit they liberated that great power resided in her blade; she would have to prove herself worthy to unlock it.

### Battle of Fellgaunt

When political struggles between the 4 prominent merchant families in the city of Fellgaunt came to a head, Aldastrio, Domovoi, and Shizu found themselves dragged into the conflict. Soon after hostilities erupted, they joined forces with the Tulenkar clan and were sent out into contested territory to retrieve some important documents. The operation went awry when they were ambushed by a pack of displacer beasts, narrowly escaping annihilation thanks to the intervention of a halfling thieves' guild when Shizu was the last one standing.
As Aldastrio and Domovoi returned to the Tulenkar stronghold to recover and prepare for the coming siege, Shizu crossed the urban free-fire zone that once was the streets of Fellgaunt to get to the central city well, whereupon she was to meet with the halfling guildmaster and negotiate an alliance.
On the way she was ambushed by 8 paid thugs that emerged from the side streets ahead. Refusing to retreat, she paced forward and laid her hand on the hilt as the thugs charged her; one minute later, she was barely standing, but the dismembered corpses of 8 ruffians littered the street.

The negotiations with the thieves' guildc bore fruit, and Shizu returned to the keep.
When the battle proper was joined in the streets, Shizu found herself and the young fire gnome [[Droghor]] Firan far out of the Tulenkar castle with an undead army closing in on them. Shizu promptly grabbed Droghor by the scruff of his robe and, hoisting him along, sprinted to the walls; thus did Droghor come to join the Band of Blood and Brimstone.

## Legacy

Having become incredibly powerful in her own right, she afterwards returned to the Realms Beyond to reckon with the forces that had expelled her thence. A series of events that also transpired between the two worlds and included the [[Swords of the Archangels| Dawnblade]] led to her angelic ascension.

The Realms Beyond suffered an apocalyptic event soon after that rent the very fabric of magic. The resulting cosmic instability awoke the supervolcano that had birthed the islands of Yuuyami.

Sensing Yuuyami's impending doom, Shizu returned there in angelic form and rallied the people to head straight to Shikyoujin, towards the skyportal to Naerk that she had also once escaped through.
Most of the population refused to sail into the maws of the awoken smoking volcano, however several thousand did so, trusting her word; they mostly came from her native island of Torajima.

Using her newfound divine power, she completed the reconstruction of the sky tower there, destroyed a few years ago by [[Jeanne Claire Lillith]] and [[Griannimhziel]] in their own passing into Naerk.
She bade farewell to her little twin sisters, Hime and Sen, passing on [[Shiji-Sha]] to Hime, and opened the astral passage for her people to escape through. Shortly after their flight, the supervolcano consumed itself in a massive chain of eruptions, and Yuuyami was no more.

Shizu's people thus flew through the void, around the Cosmodrome and into Edhailin in the event known as [[Sennarin#the Arrival]], and are thenceforth known as the Sennarii.
The Lady of the Lake held the portal open for them to pass through on orders by Angaeradh[^30], at the cost of her life and the portal itself. The Sennarii revered her after this sacrifice, directly influencing her rise to divinity as [[Lleyn]].
Shizu and Lleyn are hence often revered jointly as the *Seitorii-no-Tenshi* (Angels of the Star Gates), *Shizukagami-sama* and *Tsukizumigami-sama* respectively.

[^1]: When young Shizu's master Toshizou Shirokuma was departing Gokumon Castle for that fateful Lords' Assembly, she asked him for the reason the school had to be involved in the civil strife; he replied with this verse. This ended up being his last words and lesson to her, and she kept it as her primary mantra. After she returned to the Realms Beyond, it resonated well with the Rosewood Harpers, and was in turn picked up by their progeny who now wander Naerk with it engraved on their Swords of the Everbright.
[^2]: A lower warrior cast of provincial _bushi_ who tended to be farmers and craftsmen rather than bureaucrats, and would fill the non-commissioned officer ranks in times of war. Their hardy lifestyle generally made them more skilled in arms and not as prone to the complacency displayed by the upper warrior class.
[^3]: It was then that she first met her legendary blade (see [[The Upholder's Promise]]).
[^4]: Kagami Ittou Ryu may be translated as "mirror one-sword style".
[^5]: Technically, Angaeradh was duty-bound to open the astral passage for any petinioner who had respectfully climbed Eltirion, but had her own reasons in persuading Shizu to stay. The mighty prophetess had peered through the strands of fate for millenia to glimpse any future where the elves would return to Athalaar. The only timeline in which that might come to pass, she had foreseen, was one where the Angel of Death, wielding [[Shiji-Sha|the Upholder Blade]] high with her left arm, sprouted her wings of light in the shadow of the [[Four Winds Monastery|Four Winds]]. And from the moment Shizu had stepped into her hall with that very blade hoisted on her right waist, Angaeradh knew, she was at long last looking right at her Angel of Death.
[^6]: Once the Boneship offloaded Shizu near the cliffs an hour away from Erstal, it sank to the depths and remained in that exact spot where in 6 years it would be called up again to transport the [[7th Silver Flame Guardians]], bearing the [[Dawnblade]], back to the shores of Selanaar.
[^30]: Torajima had a large elven population, and most of them heeded Shizu's call. Angaeradh saw this as the long-awaited return of the elves to Athalaar that she had foreseen and yearned for, when she gave Shizu her Angel of Death portent. That elven population now makes up the bulk of the Sennarii Clans of Mist.
