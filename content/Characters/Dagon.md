The lord of Cocitus, the first layer of Hell. He has two forms: one of a fish-man and one of a giant satanic octopus. Dagon has a very bad reputation within Hell and is relatively isolated, mainly because he was [[Raptazeal]]'s friend, and because he is considered by many to have similar ambitions for gaining power.
