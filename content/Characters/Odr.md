A dwarven general during the [[Decade War of Arbader and South Darrok]] that ordered a retreat from [[Queenswood]] forest when general [[Toldar]] captured an ancient fortress and killed the elven general [[Minthariel]]. He lost many dwarven warriors on the retreat.

After the massacre at [[Queenswood]], Arbader's forces began to advance north. They eventually crossed the forest's edge and began to plunder what was left of the [[Volprost Plains]]. Darrok's army had been disorganized but soon managed to regroup in the main camps of Relmon and Irmast. [[Gwendoline]] organized three cavalry battalions with General [[Odr]] and General [[Mennis]] and they plowed through the valleys. On their way they found countless disorganized [[Arbader]] soldiers, who had been far removed from their supplies, and in the open valleys the cavalry had a huge advantage. Their war bulls trampled the soldiers who were looting villages without any cohesion.
