A devoted paladin of the [[Luminous Sword]]. He fights with his armored fists, named Valor and Justice. He is a friend of [[Kerythras]] Drunkenfist.

## Vethfall

Grok arrived in [[Oventhart]] during the late stage of the battle of [[Vethfall]] and fought the abominations of [[Yast]] with the [[Halcyon]] group.

## Tarthyn Invasion

During the [[Tarthyn Invasion]], Grok was garissoned on the walls. An ironclad siegebreaker, [[Nolgor]] Dalx, threw him away but he rose and began to strike at him with his iron fists, glowing with divine magic. Nolgor struck him in the chest with his hammer, but Grok answered with blows that rang through the fiendish soldier's armaments. A guard jumped at him from behind and tried to knock him down, but was injured by the violently swinging steel spikes of his helmet. Nolgor turned and melted his head with his boot. Then Grok found time and started throwing repeated punches at Nolgor, bringing him to his knees. With a sudden movement, however, he struck his jaw with the hammer and flung the devotee away. Nolgor rushed to finish him off but suddenly a huge wall of fire appeared in front of him. He ran into it and emerged unscathed, only to see a collapsed part of the wall in front of him. He roared and continued to walk in the void as he understood the illusion. A gnome mage had taken up position behind Grok and was delaying him with deceptive spells. Grok was down though, so he made him invisible with one spell and with a second they jumped to the opposite tower.

He took part in the negotiations of the next day on the side of [[King Odern]] as he parleyed with [[Rongerak]] from [[Kambah]].


## Journey to Drozzin

After the city was breached, he retreated with the refugees and eventually travelled to [[Hashnev]]. From there, he embarked on a boat leading to [[Drozzin]]. After many months of travel, he disembarked on [[Newport]].
