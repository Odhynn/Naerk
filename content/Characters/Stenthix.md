A silver dragon from [[Sunshine]] and the loyal ally and mount of general [[Torris]] Lionhead. He fought on several battles on [[Volprost Plains]] and was caused massive casualties at the [[Arbader]] lines of bugbear.

When the [[Crimson Steel]] attacked [[Torris]] one night, they used a large crossbow that was next to the dragon to kill him on the spot. Taken by surprise, Torris awoke and fought his assassins valiantly with only a few guards by his side. He laid down several dead, but he too eventually fell.
