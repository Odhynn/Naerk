An ancient elven archer in [[Blackwoods]] and ancestor of [[Aeluril]].
As described in [[Alenuril, the Impossible Shot]], his father fought valiantly in the [[Ghost War]] and died wounded and poisoned shortly after the battle, while he hid as a child and killed a skeleton with his first succesful arrow shot.
