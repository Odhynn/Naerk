Alazir grew to witness the fall of the [[Edhellin]] and was enslaved by orcs. He was stubborn and unyielding in his determination. He rebelled against the orc occupation of [[edhelwood]] and rallied the exiled elves from all [[Naerk]] to return and fight. He help establish the elven nation of [[Naryal]] and [[Volrek]] gave Alazir a seed to plant in the forest. This seed grew into a beautiful Willow, also known as [[Ilmariel]], and the elves kept its location a secret.

He is believed to be the grandson of [[Talyrian]], though he himself remained silent on his parentage. He was stubborn and unyielding in his determination.
