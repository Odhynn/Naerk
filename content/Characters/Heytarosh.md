One of the few survivors of the [[Battle of the Gap]], the taciturn gnome crossbowman was driven to Marleon arena due to debts. He was finally able to get out, after an epic battle when his team fought against fifty gladiators. He invested in new equipment and was then hired by [[Ternath]], in whose service he demonstrated such skill that he is now a permanent sight of the temple guard and the palace gates as a member of the [[Kenorex]].
