## Description

A mage with tremendous powers and perhaps the best mage specializing in elemental magic.

## Early Life

Born to "executive" parents of the [[Ashiro's Legacy]], he also became a member at a very young age. He began to read magic texts at a very young age and had set his life's goal to unlock the secrets of Ashiro's magic and manage to translate as many encrypted scriptures as he had left behind, since, as he said smugly _"I am very talented in magic even for an elf, if I can't do it, then who?"_ Kemil traveled a lot and had difficult adventures that even the most skilled warriors in history would not underestimate.

## Elemental Mastery

In an instance of his travels, all his fellow travelers gave their lives while he was finishing a spell to lock one of the higher [[Demons]] back into the [[Abyss]] which he barely managed to finish it with his life. After that, he permanently settled in Warm or as it is otherwise known "the river that should not exist", probably because he believed that Warm was a creation of [[Ashiro]] and that it would be a suitable place to study magic and the magical scriptures that "the Greatest Elf" had left behind. He set up his laboratories in the river to study and it was probably there that he completed his specialization in elemental magic. An idea had been planted in his mind, that since the [[Elemental Lords]] were the most powerful gods, perhaps they were the ones who had blessed Ashiro, that perhaps the study of elemental magic was the key to deciphering the secret scriptures. After almost two centuries, he created a spell that fundamentally changed one element into another (although many say he deciphered an Ashiro scroll that contained this spell) and many elemental magic spells have been based on it.

## [[Ashiro's Legacy]]

During the years he settled in [[Warm River]], [[Ashiro's Legacy]] gained mass appeal for the first time and simultaneously, its first enemies. Gangs hunting down and killing their members and the first aggressive moves by [[Oventhart]]'s government is what made Kemil a beacon of hope for various members of the legacy as he and his area could be a safe haven for them. Even for Kemil himself, the influx of people and the development of trade in the region to provide him with what he needed for his experiments was something very legitimate, so he endorsed it.
