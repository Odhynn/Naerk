A mage with tremendous powers and perhaps the best mage specializing in elemental magic. He settled in the area of the [[Warm River]] and set up his laboratories to study and it was probably there that he completed his specialization in elemental magic. It was during those years that [[Ashiro's Legacy]] gained mass appeal for the first time and simultaneously, its first enemies. Gangs hunting down and killing their members and the first aggressive moves by [[Oventhart]]'s government is what made Kemil a beacon of hope for various members of the legacy as he and his area could be a safe haven for them. Even for Kemil himself, the influx of people and the development of trade in the region to provide him with what he needed for his experiments was something very legitimate, so he endorsed it.
