An elven sorceress and a direct descendant of the high elves of [[Eltirion]]. A lover of [[Zhansur]] and the mother of [[Angærað]]. She raised her daughter to be a watcher of the skies like her elven ancestors, to lament their fall from rule and subsequent decimation, and to loathe the ruling dwarven castes for bringing all this to pass.
