A feared assassin of the North and highly controversial figure, full of mystery and unnerving rumors speaking of madness, betrayal, as well as great achievements. His very name instills fear on the hearts of even the bravest warriors. Its difficult when facing him to realise [[The Biggest Threat]]. He is the war leader of the [[Skra]] tribe and a protagonist of the [[Murder Hawk and Linnorm Hunter Saga]]. He has an open enmity since with [[Falgyrd]] Bolrag.

He fought cunningly at the [[Second Battle of Kiribung]] in order to avenge the death of his brother [[Baga]] from the assault of [[Volnoch]] warriors. He deviced a battle plan and circled the [[Kiribung]] lake, avoiding [[Daral]] spies and attacking the [[Jargon]]-led force from behind, during their assault at the Skra camp and [[Helden]]. When he arrived and saw Jargon momentarily unprotected, he climbed a tree and leapt upon him, driving his ax into his skull. [[Trygg]] rushed at the assassin, but it was too late: Jargon was dead. This was a critical morale blow for [[Volnoch]]. They fled, while a few [[Raka]] archers shot arrows at the Skra to stop the pursuit.
