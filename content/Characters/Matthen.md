**Matthen Bluntnose**

A giant half-orc. Originally a member of the king's guard, he was banished from the palace when it was learned that he was selling protection in shops in the city and was involved in various fights and murders. He seemed to have quite a few thugs who respected him, and even more that threatened or blackmailed into doing his bidding. Brawn of the [[Khalarsnake]].
