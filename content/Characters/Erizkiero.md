*The Blinding Wing*
Youngest son of [[Nentha]]
Enmity with [[Draun'Vlohoth]]
Jealous of his brother [[Orhodrai]]

[[Nentha]]'s only surviving son, [[Erizkiero]], is arrogant, without any particular reason to deserve more respect than his father. He is eager to take power, but is blinded by arrogance and ego. Nentha tries in every way to find someone else to take the place of the king of [[Sunshine]], as he believes that if the island falls into the hands of his son, all his efforts will be wasted.
