Valerio was already well-known when he first appeared in [[Almarica]], but for the wrong reasons. He was a renowned warrior from the [[Wyvern Fang]] mountains, and had even fashioned a cape from the scales of a Wyvern he had killed himself. He initially became a guard and soon became captain of the city's guard. Most of the townspeople and priests treated him with indifference, as they abhorred violence in general, and as a city with minimal crime, the role of the guards was mainly to deal with external threats or ceremonial.

This was a new reality that had deeply troubled Valerio. He had believed that in the city his fighting skills would be appreciated, and yet his very strength here became a reason for social isolation. The first pirate raids on [[Walajat]] found him leading a company and repelling them with few losses of his own. And yet, he received no decorations or recognition, beyond the formal confirmation that he had done his duty.

As he began to guard the magnificent temple of Sigard from time to time, he inevitably came into contact with the priests there. And it was they who opened his eyes. They spoke to him about the peace of his soul, about the rejection of violence as a solution to his problems. Although skeptical, Valerio began to attend services and study the sacred texts of [[Sigard]] and Saint [[Felippe]].

He was well into his forties when he handed over his sword to the next captain, took up a cane and became a member of the Clergy. Timidly, he began his first prayers, which gradually became spell incantations. He embraced the order's values ​​of justice and peace and gradually rose through the ranks of the Temple. Valerio soon became a member of the Holy Convocation of the [[Divinalis]], representing the values ​​of [[Sigard]] and ensuring the well-being of the city at a time when pirate attacks had begun to escalate.

For Sigard's followers, he was confirmation that even the most violent can embrace peace. It was a clear demonstration of the power of their faith. For the ordinary people of the city, however, he was also a hero, who had proven his worth in battle. And this was what made him so beloved, while he was humble at the same time and listened to the opinions and criticism of every citizen.

When the pirates attacked Walajat again, after many years, Valerio went alone. His scaled cape shone golden in the light of the Higher Dimensions. His voice, crystal clear, could be heard from the city to the coast, crystal clear to everyone. "Raise your sails, sailors, and set sail for other shores! Let no blood be shed today!" And indeed, as if by miracle, the pirates turned and fled. And his words were carved on a slab on the shore, acting as a repulsion to any pirate who dared to approach hostilely.
