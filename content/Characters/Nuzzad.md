A human wizard that ruled [[Whitecross]] since 4728. In a situation that ranged from verbal attacks to violent clashes on both sides, the city was taken over by him and he guaranteed its security. However, as he was human, everyone noticed that he took measures that were particularly favorable to them. On the contrary, he rapidly increased taxation on the elves, until he practically led to their expulsion from the city. All this was more or less known to the king of Oventhart, but most believe that due to the Ashiro legacy it was difficult to see that the king took a position in favor of one side or the other. Within a year of Nazzad's appearance, the elves had left Whitecross.
