These were the words of Archbishop Felippe Sandiaz, when in the spring of the year 4478 he journeyed to the desert of [[On-Herja]], in southeast [[Whistor]]. A few pilgrims followed him, followers of [[Sigard]]. Half of them were foreigners, coming from [[Imtaria]] and [[Oromil]]. No one took him seriously at first. They thought he had simply gone mad from some vision of his god and drove the priesthood to a futile cause.

In an oasis, which had wells of water, Felippe built a church. There he began to preach his faith daily. He spoke of peace, harmony, and honor, concepts that have been almost forgotten in the land. Pirates had ravaged the countryside, and bandits the cities. Anyone who did not cooperate with them was in danger, and the country was practically ruled by a few corsairs who supported the king while he turned a blind eye to their crimes.

The priests of Sigard had opposed this from the first moment. But, as their faith prevented them from fighting, they often ended up victims of the destructive fury of the bandits. Many say that Felippe chose isolation to save the priesthood of [[Vhitú]], others that he simply wanted to save himself.

## City

Whatever the reason, what began as a pilgrimage of hermits soon ended up as a permanent settlement. More and more believers sought refuge there, first from [[Vhitú]] and eventually from the whole country. Clergy and flock found refuge there under Felippe's guidance and the area was built and grew. Gardens were filled with exotic plants and the water from the wells rose and passed through canals to all the houses. Gradually, the area grew and reached the dimensions of a city. And the name given to it was Almarica, the flower of the desert.

The migration to [[Almarica]] took place at a time when violence had multiplied in the country. But beyond its religious character, the city was also a refuge for any peasant seeking salvation. And none of those who entered dared challenge the authority of Felippe and the followers of [[Sigard]]. In this way, their religious power gradually turned into politics, and within three years, as the city continued to grow, it practically constituted the co-capital of the country. Walls protected it and soon priests from [[Sumril]] and [[Hansa]] also sought refuge there, with Felippe receiving them warmly.

## 700 Days of Shadow

The events that followed clearly demonstrated that Felippe, regardless of his intentions, had anticipated the worst. The whole country went into darkess and it is said that for 700 days the sun did not appear again. Undead and shadows in numbers showed everywhere and began to attack cities and villages. Massacres were taking place on a daily basis, and even in [[Sjemhe]] no one was safe. The creatures of darkness also attacked [[Almarica]], but the priests kept the darkness away from the city.

Felippe did not stand idle. He came into contact with the clergy of [[Sumril]] and [[Hansa]] and they agreed to a Holy Convocation in 4483. This Convocation, also known as the First Convocation of the Triad of Almarica, took on a permanent character and was called [[Divinalis]]. The priesthoods agreed to act together to drive out the undead, protect the citizens, and safeguard the national sovereignty of [[Whistor]]. Each of the three religions had some taboo: the peace of Sigard, the spirituality and harmony of Sumril and the learning and knowledge of Hansa, which prevented the priesthood from taking action in some areas: There, the Divinalis created orders which could, with the assistance of priests from all three priesthoods, respond to any possible challenge.

Based in Almarica, dozens of Divinalis orders began to emerge and spread across the country. They gathered the people, proclaiming the positions of the gods and the Convocation of [[Divinalis]], and created centers of self-government and defence in each settlement. The local priests, for the most part, agreed to join the orders, while those who refused were labeled heretics and friends of the pirates. The power of Divinalis was able to repel many raids, while a decisive battle was fought in Vhitu, where the invaders and the creatures of Darkness fled before the power of the clergy and the people and the first rays of light returned to the land, as the darkness was broken after powerful prayers. The final stop was the overthrow of the puppet king of [[Sjemhe]] and the establishment of a nomad as king who had the blessing of the Convocation. Thus, the [[700 Days of Shadow]] came to an end.
