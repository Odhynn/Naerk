## Story

Eberk Ironglance was an honorable priest at [[Ramsel]] Monastery. He denounced the ways of the priests and foretold their doom, as he left and travelled south in solitude. During his travels, he met [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]] that wanted to sell a [[Solarium Ring]] at an auction, not realising its value. He stepped forth, after bying it, told them the story behind the relic and invited him to embark with him on a quest to cleanse the monastery. He tried to atone before his god with his deeds. They destroyed the undead there and he was redeemed in the eyes of [[Yerastu]] and his faith. He restored the temple of Ramsel to its former glory and created a holy order of warriors to uphold the defence of the northern Oromil and defend the ring. The order was named [[Ironglance]] after him. Under his watch, the ring was stolen by [[Salkor|a thief]].
