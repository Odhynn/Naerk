When [[Voolthow]] abused his friendship to [[Hozetul]] and sent his minions to infiltrate the Dreamworld, several nightmares resisted his influence. These attacks were unexpectedly successful because they specifically targeted only those who interfered with the unwritten rules of not meddling with the physical and spiritual state of the dreamers. Then, the more cowardly, found it in their best interest to ally with the nightmares, as they would escape Voolthow's control. And this alliance was called [[Twalar]]. Their results were multiplicative, as each invader they destroyed saved hundreds of mortals from their torment, and the more mortals Voolthow lost, the harder it was for him to invade the Dreamworld.

Soon Voolthow lost almost all the channels he had to send his dark magic to the Dreamworld. The Wayangs and those who had defected, however, were trapped in the world of dreams. And they knew that if they left thence, Voolthow would hunt them down and bend them to his will, since he punished some exemplarily. And the [[Twalar]] faced this problem in unison. They found ways to send some Wayang souls in the mornings when mortals awoke through dreams into the [[Material Plane]], and they settled there, in absolute secrecy, in the most secret corners of the world: [[Kelonarie]] and [[Drozzin]]. There they had a chance to be able to take control of their own destinies and lives, without being servants to anyone.
