From the early years of [[Hithlwin]]'s founding in 4363, the [[Hithlen]] Senate was the highest body in the land. This was at the same time the only factor that could guarantee its prosperity and stability, at a time when the various regions wanted a greater share in the exercise of power. For their protection, they founded a special monastery, also known as [[Balaruna Fortress]], in which a special unit of warriors, the swordsmen of Balaruna, began to be trained hard from babies.

This is an elite unit, permanently numbering twenty-seven of the monastery's best swordsmen, with another twenty-seven reservists trained to take the place of the first if needed and to protect the families of the Senate members. To say that the swordsmen of Balaruna are the best swordsmen and bodyguards is not enough to describe the breadth and depth of training they have undergone. The babies who go annually to the temple are many times more than the twenty-seven final runners-up and the twenty-seven reserves after the harsh trials.

Many mothers give babies to the temple, mostly out of unwanted pledges: And this act is considered sacred in the eyes of [[Sumril]], the goddess of the Hithlen. Children learn to live on little food, to survive in nature, to be constantly on the lookout, and to develop no friendly feelings for any living creature. And every two years, a sacred ceremony takes place, on the day of the Summer Solstice, also known as the Crossed Blades: There, the twenty-seven Swords must defeat all the remaining graduating swordsmen of the monastery, in a battle to the death. And there often many faint and break: their lot is to become common sergeants in Hithlwin's army, who often die heroically in their first battle to restore their lost honor: these are known as Masherma, the Rusted Swords, and are held in high esteem persons until their death.

In the histories of Hithlen, the exploits of all 54 per period graduates of the monastery are detailed. Their deeds rank them among the best warriors in all of Hithlwin: Some single-handedly held off entire battalions of assassins, while others slaughtered hordes of enemies in battle, even [[Asura]] assassins and generals. The chronicle of their epics is an integral part of Hithlen culture, and they are worshiped as holy figures by all inhabitants, regardless of rank. Their leader is considered a demigod, named Salendra, and wields the Merevitra, a sword made from a metal from [[Utopia]], the creation of which is lost deep in the past.
