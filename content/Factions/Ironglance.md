A holy order formed by [[Eberk]] and named after him to defend Oromil. At first it started at 4777 after the reclamation of [[Ramsel]] keep. A lot of warriors were trained and soon bands spread out to the northern regions of [[Oromil]] and eventually to the whole country. Councellors sent to [[Palaurim]] are always accompanied by members of Ironglance as their escort and guard. They include pious healers, priests and holy knights vowed to serve till death.
