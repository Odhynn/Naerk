The Volnoch tribe is rooted in the northern part of the [[Fervolosh]], a place with huge old pine trees. They had full control of the [[Kiribung]] lake, until the southern part fell to [[Skra]] hands after the defeat of the [[Second Battle of Kiribung]] and the death of the son of Elder [[Kaldran]], [[Jargon]].
