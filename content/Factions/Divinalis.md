## First Convocation of the Triad

During the [[700 Days of Shadow]], the Archbishop [[Felippe]] Sandiaz came into contact with the clergy of [[Sumril]] and [[Hansa]] and they agreed to a Holy Convocation in 4483. This Convocation, also known as the First Convocation of the Triad of [[Almarica]], took on a permanent character and was called [[Divinalis]]. The priesthoods agreed to act together to drive out the undead, protect the citizens, and safeguard the national sovereignty of [[Whistor]]. Each of the three religions had some taboo: the peace of Sigard, the spirituality and harmony of Sumril and the learning and knowledge of Hansa, which prevented the priesthood from taking action in some areas: There, the Divinalis created orders which could, with the assistance of priests from all three priesthoods, respond to any possible challenge.

## [[700 Days of Shadow]]

Based in Almarica, dozens of Divinalis orders began to emerge and spread across the country. They gathered the people, proclaiming the positions of the gods and the Convocation of [[Divinalis]], and created centers of self-government and defence in each settlement. The local priests, for the most part, agreed to join the orders, while those who refused were labeled heretics and friends of the pirates. The power of Divinalis was able to repel many raids, while a decisive battle was fought in Vhitu, where the invaders and the creatures of Darkness fled before the power of the clergy and the people and the first rays of light returned to the land, as the darkness was broken after powerful prayers. The final stop was the overthrow of the puppet king of [[Sjemhe]] and the establishment of a nomad as king who had the blessing of the Convocation. Thus, the [[700 Days of Shadow]] came to an end.

## Aftermath

The Divinalis Convocation carried on and played a crucial role in the rebuilding of [[Whistor]] after the destruction and chaos. It is the most dominant religion center in [[WHistor]] and its influence spreads among all civilian, military, economy and cultural matters.
