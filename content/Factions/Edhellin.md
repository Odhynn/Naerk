## Origin

The [[Edhelwood]] first saw intelligent life three millenia before [[Ghost War]]. For the first two hundred years these creatures tried to find their place in the food chain and slowly, after solving the basic subsistence problems, they began to show an innate tendency in engineering, architecture and the arts. This was part cause of their incomprehensible - even for [[Malahir]] - ability to deeply perceive the reflection of [[Veth]]'s radiation on [[Naerk]], with the result that already from -2300 they were able to manipulate this radiation in a way that even some gods found it difficult to understand. This mainly involved spells where they could alter reality and affect space-time. Their name was given by Malahir and the tribe became known as Edhellin.

## Forming of the Nation

The Edhellin - known today as the ancient elves - were tall, slender with pointed ears and their skin was a very bright shade of off-white. Their society could be called utopian, since they showed absolutely no pursuit of power over other more powerless organizations, just as there was no corruption even within their own ranks. Malahir being curious to see the limits of their civilization's prime, granted them immortality on the condition that their reproduction be controlled so as not to affect the balance of the system. Also, she was always positive towards them, despite the consultations of the other gods, that this energy of hers may in the future have a very important impact for the entire [[Material Plane]].

With the emergence of new humanoid races, the Edhellin tried to integrate them socially as well as materialistically, but noticing that the other races lacked the innate ability to channel magic to the extent that the Edhellin could and this quickly put the humans in a state of fear and inferiority to the ancient elves. However, the ancient elves never sought to exploit this superiority over the other races.

## Prosperity

This peace, however, was to be brought to an end by a sequence of disruptive events that no one could have foreseen. It all started in -2000, where [[Voolthow]], recognizing the terrifying and potentially infinite capacity for continuous evolution of the Edhellin, gave the Elf [[King Erlamin]] a crystal ball that later became known as the orb of deception or better known as the orb of darkness: [[Vaelasil]].

Erlamin was one of the first Edhellin and his wisdom was acknowledged by all the ancient elves. And his magical ability scared [[Voolthow]] himself, as he believed that in a millenia, he could even pose a danger to the power of the gods. So he took the initiative to give him the magic orb, which in addition to unlimited power, gave its owner the characteristics of arrogance and corruption, concepts that the ancient elven language didn't even have words for to be able to interpret.

From -2000 to -1800 the heyday of the Edhellin society grew exponentially and reached its absolute peak. At that time, they reached a milestone of the powerful reality/time - alteration spell cast by the powerful wizard [[Sylris]] to turn back time 7 days for for the elves to prevent a fire that burned half of the [[Edhelwood]] forest and almost completely destroyed the fauna of the area. The Elves at the same time were able to create a realm, within Edhelwood, in the deepest part of the forest that was connected to the [[Evergrowing Forest]], and many Edhellin could come and go between the two planes at will.

## Corruption

In the middle of the next century the first signs of the orb's influence began to be felt, as the Elf king forced very strong wizards to work on creating powerful magical weapons. This also had social ramifications, as a series of policies discredited the strongest among the Edhellin as the elite of the realm, and in less than 100 years the social stratifications within the ranks of the elves were now noticeable. Little by little they started to use other tribes as subordinates without of course a militaristic confrontation, since no one could even imagine that they could stand up to the mighty elves.

During this century, five different factions were formed, each with its own agenda and trying to gain more and more of the Elf king's trust. The names of the leaders of each faction were as follows: [[Thelar]], [[Sarfir]], [[Aela]], [[Virdithas]] and [[Keldan]]. An unprecedented power play begun and even if there was never any fighting between the factions, espionage was taking its first steps and assassinations were already on the agenda of some of them.

Seeing this anomaly that was eroding the kingdom day by day, the powerful wizard Sylris called the faction leaders and the king to a council. He addressed them inquiring why all this strife was happening and what it was for. He then saw the king rise menacingly and accuse him of betraying the [[Edhellin]] nation, as he believed that the only reason the council was called is because of Sylris' personal ambitions.

Sylris coldly replied, _"You are out of your mind! This orb you hold in your hands will ultimately bring about the destruction of our race!"_

Erlamin's mocking reply was, _"Really, you think you're going to influence my government with baseless accusations? Is this all happening because you want it to? The orb to come into your possession?"_

Erlamin recognizing how dangerous a rival Sylris could make for his power, revoked him as a traitor to the Edhellin, an ally of humans and dragons (as he maintained excellent relations with dragons as well as human kings). Thus Sylris became the first exile of the [[Edhellin]] at the year -1610.
