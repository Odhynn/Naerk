## Origin

The [[Edhelwood]] first saw intelligent life three millenia before [[Ghost War]]. For the first two hundred years these creatures tried to find their place in the food chain and slowly, after solving the basic subsistence problems, they began to show an innate tendency in engineering, architecture and the arts. This was part cause of their incomprehensible - even for [[Malahir]] - ability to deeply perceive the reflection of [[Veth]]'s radiation on [[Naerk]], with the result that already from -2300 they were able to manipulate this radiation in a way that even some gods found it difficult to understand. This mainly involved spells where they could alter reality and affect space-time. Their name was given by Malahir and the tribe became known as Edhellin.

## Forming of the Nation

The Edhellin - known today as the ancient elves - were tall, slender with pointed ears and their skin was a very bright shade of off-white. Their society could be called utopian, since they showed absolutely no pursuit of power over other more powerless organizations, just as there was no corruption even within their own ranks. Malahir being curious to see the limits of their civilization's prime, granted them immortality on the condition that their reproduction be controlled so as not to affect the balance of the system. Also, she was always positive towards them, despite the consultations of the other gods, that this energy of hers may in the future have a very important impact for the entire [[Material Plane]].

With the emergence of new humanoid races, the Edhellin tried to integrate them socially as well as materialistically, but noticing that the other races lacked the innate ability to channel magic to the extent that the Edhellin could and this quickly put the humans in a state of fear and inferiority to the ancient elves. However, the ancient elves never sought to exploit this superiority over the other races.

## Prosperity

This peace, however, was to be brought to an end by a sequence of disruptive events that no one could have foreseen. It all started in -2000, where [[Voolthow]], recognizing the terrifying and potentially infinite capacity for continuous evolution of the Edhellin, gave the Elf [[King Erlamin]] a crystal ball that later became known as the orb of deception or better known as the orb of darkness: [[Vaelasil]].

Erlamin was one of the first Edhellin and his wisdom was acknowledged by all the ancient elves. And his magical ability scared [[Voolthow]] himself, as he believed that in a millenia, he could even pose a danger to the power of the gods. So he took the initiative to give him the magic orb, which in addition to unlimited power, gave its owner the characteristics of arrogance and corruption, concepts that the ancient elven language didn't even have words for to be able to interpret.

From -2000 to -1800 the heyday of the Edhellin society grew exponentially and reached its absolute peak. At that time, they reached a milestone of the powerful reality/time - alteration spell cast by the powerful wizard [[Sylris]] to turn back time 7 days for for the elves to prevent a fire that burned half of the [[Edhelwood]] forest and almost completely destroyed the fauna of the area. The Elves at the same time were able to create a realm, within Edhelwood, in the deepest part of the forest that was connected to the [[Evergrowing Forest]], and many Edhellin could come and go between the two planes at will.

## Corruption

In the middle of the next century the first signs of the orb's influence began to be felt, as the Elf king forced very strong wizards to work on creating powerful magical weapons. This also had social ramifications, as a series of policies discredited the strongest among the Edhellin as the elite of the realm, and in less than 100 years the social stratifications within the ranks of the elves were now noticeable. Little by little they started to use other tribes as subordinates without of course a militaristic confrontation, since no one could even imagine that they could stand up to the mighty elves.

During this century, five different factions were formed, each with its own agenda and trying to gain more and more of the Elf king's trust. The names of the leaders of each faction were as follows: [[Thelar]], [[Sarfir]], [[Aela]], [[Virdithas]] and [[Keldan]]. An unprecedented power play begun and even if there was never any fighting between the factions, espionage was taking its first steps and assassinations were already on the agenda of some of them.

Seeing this anomaly that was eroding the kingdom day by day, the powerful wizard Sylris called the faction leaders and the king to a council. He addressed them inquiring why all this strife was happening and what it was for. He then saw the king rise menacingly and accuse him of betraying the [[Edhellin]] nation, as he believed that the only reason the council was called is because of Sylris' personal ambitions.

Sylris coldly replied, _"You are out of your mind! This orb you hold in your hands will ultimately bring about the destruction of our race!"_

Erlamin's mocking reply was, _"Really, you think you're going to influence my government with baseless accusations? Is this all happening because you want it to? The orb to come into your possession?"_

Erlamin recognizing how dangerous a rival Sylris could make for his power, revoked him as a traitor to the Edhellin, an ally of humans and dragons (as he maintained excellent relations with dragons as well as human kings). Thus Sylris became the first exile of the [[Edhellin]] at the year -1603.

Just a few days after the council failed, a bewildered Sylris, trying to find a solution to the impasse in which Edhellin society has fallen, seeked out his good friend [[Nentha]] -an all-wise and powerful gold wyrm- for advice. The meeting took place on [[Sunshine]] island where Nentha still lives today. [[Nentha]] as he was informed of the situation, decided that the Elven king should be dethroned immediately, because his thirst for power would cause problems that would become uncontrollable and possibly a war of enormous scope could be caused that would leave the whole Naerk ruined. Therefore, the solution he proposed had to be drastic, without at the same time running the risk of a diplomatic episode between the dragons and the Edhellin. Therefore, he came up with the idea that Sylris would have to steal the orb himself and learn how to use it. So Nentha's identity had to be kept a secret until the end of the mission.

The preparation for stealing the orb took almost 50 years. In -1550 Sylris was ready to make his move. This was made really easy since Sylris was the strongest time mage to ever set foot in [[Naerk]]. So he returned to the Edhellin realm and before the Elf king could attack him himself, Sylris stopped time for about 5 minutes to remove the orb from the Elf king's possession. He immediately escaped and the greatest manhunt the world had ever seen took place. Hundreds of Edhellin had swarmed all over Naerk trying to locate Sylris in order to retrieve the orb. There was absolutely no safe place for Sylris and as if it wasn't enough that he had to find safe haven, he also needed time to learn how to use the orb.

Nentha and Sylris' first thought was to destroy the orb. Alas, even with the most powerful spells that these powerful entities had at their disposal, destroying the orb was not possible. Therefore, Sylris' only choice was to learn how to use this powerful weapon and quickly, before the war breaks out. Being desperate, Nentha had a very risky idea that could, under conditions, work. Nentha had no special abilities to perform powerful space-time magic spells, but he knew very well how the planes outside the material plane are structured. So the two of them cast a spell that even by the standards of the gods was completely unimaginable. They created a hole in space-time and went into a new orbit with it. The spell became known in history as Temporal Streamline Jump.

The result of this action was that they were washed into a parallel reality where the concept of time had no meaning at all. There, they began to study the orb's properties and conduct experiments. It occurred to them to abandon the orb in this dimension and go back, but in the end it was never an option, since the corruption of the Elf king had reached such a state that the start of war seemed inevitable. The only way out was his death. But there was one main problem. In addition to being immortal, the Elf king possessed such powerful destructive magic that it would be a great challenge even to Nentha's strength. Besides, Sylris was no warrior. He had never been involved in developing destructive magic.

After hundreds of years of being in the other dimension (having only spent moments on the [[Material Plane]]) they came to realize that the orb's true use was its ability to open vortices in the transparent mantle that separated the Material Plane from the [[Etherial Plane]]. This gave them automatically an idea of ​​how they could proceed in the battle. The centuries that passed until he learned to use the orb corrupted him enough, but with the help of Nentha he managed to keep his sanity and not be distracted by his purpose. But it would be safe to say that Sylris now had less pure intentions and more of a thirst for revenge on the [[King Erlamin|Elf king]]. Several months more had to be spent by Nentha and Sylris until they could find the right timeline again and return to Naerk (after Sylris had learned to manipulate the orb). The preparations were over and the most important battle in Naerk's ancient history was about to begin.

Sylris made his presence known to the Elf king through Nentha's telepathy, informing him to come in person to negotiate in [[Edhelwood]] forest. He informed him that he had two days to appear or he would destroy the orb. The other condition was that he could only bring the faction leaders and no one else, unless he wanted Sylris to disappear with the orb using time magic and destroy it along the way. This was certainly a bluff, but the Elf king was in no position to risk it. As soon as the king received the message he was driven mad by his hatred for Sylris. He tried to restrain himself from completely destroying his kingdom. A subject of his was blackmailing him and there was nothing he could do to stop him. So he called the faction leaders and informed them that they should be ready for battle the next day. The Elf king calmed down in the next few hours from his rage and although he understood that he would be playing in the enemy's territory, he thought that he had not something to fear, since even Nentha could be dealt with by the six elves without serious casualties. Sylris was not a threat to any of them, as his knowledge of destructive type magic did not exceed that of an average Edhellin. The meeting between the six Edhellin and Sylris-Nentha took place only a week after the orb was stolen. The atmosphere was tense, although neither side wanted to show their irritation.

As the Elf king saw Nentha, immediately taunted him and said _"Are you so afraid of me that you create all this nonsense, are you postponing your impending death? Do you still think you rule the most powerful country in Naerk? Whatever happens here today, know that the Edhellin will rule over the dragons if you continue to cause trouble in my rule. From this encounter, I have absolutely nothing to lose. I couldn't say the same for you, of course."_

Nentha did not respond in the same style to the Elf king's challenges. He spoke to him lovingly and said, _"No one here wants to dethrone you. All we want is for you to come to your senses. You are leading your people into impending war with your actions. Dragons are no threat to your kingdom. The only threat to it is you and the other five around you."_

Virdithas jumped in and replied _"You dragons fear our evolution and try to enslave us with insidious methods. I don't even understand why we're sitting and talking to a dragon and his ruffian."_ He got up from the table and casted a powerful electricity spell aimed at Sylris.

Nentha put his wing up as a shield and moved away from the table with Sylris. He told him that he would be able to keep the elves busy for a few minutes until Sylris could finish casting a powerful sealing spell with the help of the [[Vaelasil|orb]].
