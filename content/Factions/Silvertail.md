The Silvertail were created by [[Huntsman]] rangers as a response to [[Warclaw]] and untamed werewolf attacks near [[Tithlon]]. [[Gerius]], a [[Warclaw]] leader was captured and sacrificed in a ritual to grant the rangers werewolf powers in a more controlled form. Those warriors were then devoted to stop their untamed kin that was ravaging the countryside.

What still divides the sages today, is that the ceremony took place in a secret place: In a Rezal tree, which even had a guardian. The guardian stated that the ceremony was performed in his ignorance, and only a very powerful druid could bypass the protective barriers and perform the ceremony. Even today, this act is considered reprehensible in druid circles, and is one of the main reasons that despite their good intentions, the werewolves of Huntsman are often viewed with prejudice by elves and druids.
