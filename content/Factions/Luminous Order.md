## Honor and Justice: the Order of Laerion

[[Laerion]]'s order, also known as the Luminous Order, first appeared in [[Green Hills]] when the goblin attacks from [[Paraselt]] began in the year 3125. It was originally formed in [[Dargonast]], where it was embraced by a large portion of the town's population. Later, it was extended to other cities, such as [[Ostrabit]], where the highest authority of the priesthood and the order was transferred there.

Not many months had passed, when an important dichotomy arose among the believers, which was to be decisive. With the first goblin attacks successfully repulsed, there was disagreement as to what the order's next steps should be.

The first opinion, mainly from priests and elders, said that they should devote themselves to improving the situation in Green Hills: Fighting corruption, improving the justice system, and rebuilding and developing the kingdom and fortifications. The second opinion, which was embraced by younger people, as well as by several who had lost their families and property, was to go on a campaign to Paraselt.

## Formation of Luminous Sword

This disagreement could not be bridged, despite various meetings and discussions. Thus, a second battalion, the [[Luminous Sword]], was created, which began to recruit soldiers and villagers and moved to the border. They began recapturing new areas from the goblins south of the Green Hills, and with the help of the Luminous Order, these areas were manned, fortified, and an acritic army was created and settled there permanently. The Luminous Order, in agreement with the king, took care of the tax relief of these areas, and the fair distribution of the land.
