## Origin

A group of thieves, rascals and scoundrel fey that abuses [[Portal]] use. The [[Druid]] circles tried to limit their activity but in most battles they simply slipped away. Then, [[Oliven]], one of the senior druids, suggested that they find all the portals and seal them, because only in this way could the evil be contained. Thus, druids and rangers, with the help of [[Sylvanaya|Vel Rezal]] trees and elves, found most of the portals one by one: In tree trunks, in lakes, in oases, in caves and in roots. Some they closed permanently, some they sealed, and in some they appointed protectors or guardians from the natural world or from the younger races of men or gnomes.

## After Vethfall

These portals came to the fore again after the [[Vethfall]]. Traditional magical ways of teleportation and dimensional change began to fail, making the portals' value enormous. Accordingly, the Thorny Passage, who had survived and been forgotten, resumed tormenting travelers and gaining power from the few portals they had in hidden places under their control.
