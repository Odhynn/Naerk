To begin understanding druids, their powers and limitations, one must first understand [[Malahir|nature]] itself, as a druid possesses no potential but nature has unlimited. Their abilities stem from the deep relationship they have with her. A druid sees the balance in nature in all its inner conflicts, from the smallest to the largest, from the simplest to the most complex, from the cow that eats the grass to the lions that eat the antelope, from the water that extinguishes the fire to the plants that give oxygen. The better a druid understands nature, the better he understands what he can and must do, the more he understands that the more nature [[Amehan|destroys]] the more it is destroyed and the more it gives life the more it [[Nahema|enlivens]], as he understands that the more it vitalizes the more it destroys. It is a quest of clarity of purpose.

Many druids, therefore, live permanently alienated from civilization, needing nothing but the civilization that nature itself has to teach them. So many druids end up living for years in forests, savannahs and uninhabited islands like [[Rondorvick]]. Many are "reborn" through their stay in them, always with the proper guidance from a mentor, who must teach them the way of nature and the language of the druids. But in the end, each and every one has to confirm that they understood that the powers of nature are for nature and not for reckless use: thats why many druids are forced to undertake trials to prove their devotion.

Druid groups are not a rare phenomenon, especially in cases where natural environments or rare life forms are threatened. Many times these groups are long-term or even permanent when they deem it appropriate, forming circles. Most groupings (and secondarily though not negligibly, most individual druids), recognize the decisions of the Storm Swarm and implement them, as well as participate in making those decisions when possible.

The most important (largest in members, areas of action, power) circles are:

- The [[Erle]] pack, operating in the mountains of Hoen.
- The [[Smyt'th]] herd, operating from Imtaria to Paraselt.
- The [[Fismint]], who operate in and around the Angry Sea.
- The [[Tearthis]] pack, consisting of only five individuals and active in Kambah and Oventhart.
- The [[Sylvanaya]], made up of elves and active in Edhelwood.
- The [[Il'ghana]], located in the desert of Allwick.
- The [[Silver Pact]], who are nomads and operate in Tarthyn and the Green Hills.
- The [[Circle of the Stag]], based in Sennarin's Mitheryn.
- The [[Circle of the Moose]], operating in the Athar Hunting Grounds on the border with Athalaar.
- The [[Locust Blight]], operating in Allwick, Rammok and southern Oventhart.
- The [[Ghostwatch]], based in the Blackwoods.
