To begin to understand druids, their powers and limitations, one must first understand nature itself. As a druid possesses no power but nature has unlimited. Their abilities stem from the deep relationship he has with her. A druid sees the balance in nature in all its inner conflicts, from the smallest to the largest, from the simplest to the most complex, from the cow that eats the grass to the lions that eat the antelope, from the water that extinguishes the fire to the plants that give oxygen. The better a druid understands nature, the better he understands what he can and must do, the more he understands that the more nature destroys the more it is destroyed and the more it gives life the more it enlivens, the more he understands that the more it animates the more it can destroy.

Many druids, therefore, live permanently alienated from civilization, needing nothing but the civilization that nature itself has to teach them. So many druids end up living for years in forests, savannahs and uninhabited islands like Rondorvick. While many are "born" through their stay in them, always with the proper guidance from a mentor, who must teach them the way of nature and the language of the druids. While of course in the end he has to confirm that they understood that the powers of nature are for nature and not for reckless use by making them go through trials.

Druid groupings are not a rare phenomenon, especially in cases where natural environments or rare life forms are threatened. Many times these groupings are long-term or even permanent when they deem it appropriate. Most groupings (and secondarily though not negligibly, most individual druids), recognize the decisions of the Storm Swarm and implement them, as well as participate in making those decisions when possible.

The most important (largest in members, areas of action, power) these groupings are:
-The Pack of Erle, operating in the mountains of Hoen.
-The Flock of Smyt'th, operating from Imtaria to Paraselt.
-The Fismints, who operate in and around the Angry Sea.
-The Pack of Tearthis consisting of only five individuals and active in Kambah and Oventhart.
-The Sylvanaya, made up of elves and active in Edhelwood.
-The Il'ghana, located in the desert of Allwick.
-The Silver Pact, who are nomads and operate in Tarthyn and the Green Hills.
-The Circle of the Stag, based in Sennarin's Mitheryn.
-The Circle of the Moose, operating in the Athar Hunting Grounds on the border with Athalahr.
-The Locust Blight, operating in Allwick, Rammok and southern Oventhart.
-Ghostwatch, based in the Blackwoods.
