Demonslavers derived much of their power from serving demons. With time-consuming and demanding sacrifices and ceremonies, they could summon [[demons]] who obeyed them to the letter. Often, of course, the price was enormous: Hundreds of human souls were sacrificed, while rarely did a mage escape the Abyss upon death. All too soon, arrogance overwhelmed the mages of Almahr. They believed themselves to be superior to other mortals and it was hard to deny that when even the most insignificant wizard in the land had at least one demon in his service. From a moment on, most of the army was made up of demons.

Eventually things got out of hand as [[demons]] broke out of their control and started rampaging through the wizards and their cities. A huge part of the island was lost to them and their leaders, the [[Vile Septet]], until they could make protective spellwards to contain the demon attacks.

Now they still hold power in the northern part of [[Olgizmar]].
