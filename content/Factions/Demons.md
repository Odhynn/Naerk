Demons originally were [[Kenemi]] under the servitude of [[Yerastu]]. Their job was to transport the souls of the dead to the planes they were judged to live their afterlife. However, they eventually developed different opinions on where the souls should go. So, they conspired a mutiny, took the souls prone to their promise of freedom and made the [[Abyss]] in secret. Afterwards, they started stealing souls from the [[Styx]] river.
