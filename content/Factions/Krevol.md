A race of intelligent plant creatures that appeared on [[Blackwoods]] after the [[Ghost War]] and eventually spread across [[Naerk]]. Some of them are up to 6 feet tall, while others are huge, as big as normal trees. They are friendly towards most fey and druids and careful when interacting with outsiders.
