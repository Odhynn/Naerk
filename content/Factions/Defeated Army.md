## Formation

The Supreme Tyrrant [[Karahath]], shortly after he rose to power, assembled one of the biggest armies in recent [[Naerk]] history. It contained several regiments of [[Kenorex]] and clergy, orcs, warriors of Kambah as well as goblins, trolls and giants that came from [[Hoen]] mountains.

## History

They crossed [[Allwick]] desert, passed [[Paraselt]] mountains and attacked [[Green Hills]], pillaging and looting [[Fherlon]] and nearbly villages. [[King Morran IV]] of Green Hills asked for the help of [[Emperor Ilarein]] and together they fought in the [[Battle of Fherlon Plains]] to stop them. The forces of [[Petch-cro-Bor]] were tricked into charging against seemingly weak enemy formations and were eventually surrounded and slain, with many more to follow.

## Aftermath

Those that survived the battle, followed [[Arzilok the Tormentor]] and [[Hoberkorra]] to a retreat to [[Paraselt]] were they hid and sought refuge from the [[Palaurim]] armies, where they didn't dare to delve. Afterwards, their spread but still considerable big forces rallied under these two leaders and carried on skirmish attacks against Green Hills from time to time. The exact number of their forces and the native creatures that joined the army from Paraselt are unknown. One thing is certain: a storm is brewing in these mountains.

The [[Palaurim]] forces quickly started naming this force the Defeated Army, to undermine and underrate their power, and the label spread out to all [[Palaurim]] regions. The orcs and goblins adopted this name, as a motivation to rally again and avenge their fallen.
