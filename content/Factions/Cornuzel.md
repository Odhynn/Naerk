The most powerful wizards guild and association in [[Naerk]]. They operate primarily on [[Palaurim]] ground, in [[Reisdok]] and [[Imtaria]], and have the full support of the national authorities. In [[Azarak]], their Academy in [[Kleyton]], are exhibited some of the most wondrous artifacts and magical effects known.
