The largest dwarven strongholds have historically been scattered in various locations, but were located in Northern Darrok. Several orc clans coexisted in the area, centered on the [[Tarhelm]]. The battles between them were in many cases fierce, such as with [[Guldorom Horde]]. Gradually the orcs were confined to certain areas as the dwarves more easily allied with each other to deal with the invasions, resulting in the orcs being defeated in most instances. At the same time, their ability to work metal and make unique weapons and armor, combined with their impregnable fortifications, which were enhanced over the years, constantly improved their situation. Despite their harsh trials, the dwarves of [[Northern Darrok]] are now so powerful that few armies in all of Naerk are better equipped and more experienced, and they stand as a shining example of the might of their ancestors.

Many strongholds are found in [[Bj√•glant]], remote and manned by hardened warriors, who have to deal with the curse of the [[Harrowlands]] and the wild weather. These tribes maintain good relations with the orcs, and are often criticized for this by their eastern cousins. However, although they often raid ships to the south, they are still hospitable in their homeland and maintain a code of honor very close to that of other dwarves.

To the east of [[Oromil]], there is a secluded hill near the [[Rammok Wastes]]. This hill, also known as [[Kerlek]], is home to a large family of dwarves, who have dug out the entire hill, which is solid granite. The dwarves of Kerlek have for many years kept a low profile and have consistently chosen to stay out of the battles that take place around them, unless it is to defend their home. Among them are many shamans, who fifty years ago gained great power as they discovered an abandoned underground city of an extinct race of gnomes. This city had unique artifacts, from portals to the [[Earth Quarter]], to items and runes of [[Gibba]] and [[Volrek]] that allowed them to strengthen their defenses and dust off many secrets of the land that had been lost for millennia.

Further south, there is in [[Whistor]] the stronghold of the historic faction of the [[Ingotshield]], who fought the hordes of Icebringers during the Winters War. Despite the army that had come to help from Darrok, this battle took a heavy toll on the clan but over time they were able to rebuild and today it is a decent fortress. The blacksmiths use lava from the volcanoes for their furnaces, and they believe in Fyrlean, as, in addition to the fire and lava he offers them, is a natural rival to the Fallfaunt and the destruction they had suffered back then.

Lastly, in the frozen North, west of Hoss [[Glacier]], there is an isolated fortress called [[Tarnog]]. The dwarves there live solitary lives, trading weapons and armor for food with the tundra barbarians. They have a long history of fighting all manner of strange creatures and beasts of the North, and are considered the toughest of their kind.

Envoys from these five regions gather to discuss important issues affecting the entire tribe. A total of twenty-seven envoys are sent, one from each clan. The council meets on an irregular basis, and the last time it met was fifty years ago, when the Titan [[Dumspergrond]]'s army [[War of the Titan|began to threaten]] all of [[Northern Darrok]]. A basic principle of the council is that when one of the five dwarven territories is threatened, the others must help.

Mutual assistance between clans with army detachments occurs at relatively long intervals, as between the [[Winter's War]] and [[War of the Titan|Dumsper's invasion]] there were only three times that the council met, and all three were for Northern Darrok, which since it is the biggest, not much help is really needed. These instances were with the founding of [[Palaurim]], where Imtaria threatened with embargoes and raids, the [[demons]] of [[Olgizmar]], and the civil war with [[South Darrok]]. Since then, Northern Darrok has not been attacked by anyone, while the strength it has shown in these battles and the existence of the council make any potential enemy reconsider invading all four other dwarven territories and strongholds.
