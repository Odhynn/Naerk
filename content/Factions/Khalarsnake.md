A group of influential individuals that took over [[Khalaram]] during the 48th century. At first they exploited [[King Hawlfeyth]]'s favor to expand their influence and later they slowly became independent from the countries' authorities and started ruling [[Khalaram]] and its suburbs on their own.

-The first was [[Zeith Gyr]], a brilliant aristocrat of noble birth. An indefatigable traveler and educated omniscient, he had spent many years in academies and libraries collecting information that others thought was useless. Always eager, he seemed to have the answer to all questions, although many considered him slimy.

-The second was [[Matthen Bluntnose]], a giant half-orc. Originally a member of the king's guard, he was banished from the palace when it was learned that he was selling protection in shops in the city and was involved in various fights and murders. He seemed to have quite a few thugs who respected him, and even more that threatened or blackmailed into doing his bidding.
 
-The third was [[Kalar Gyr]], daughter of Zeith and an elf. To most, she was just a princess, helping her father with his chores. What most people didn't know, however, is that at night she was Nyrda: An executioner who went out and killed criminals. A ruthless killer who left a black and white note with a snake on it for her victims.
 
-The fourth was [[Hurdali Khamarnaya]], a Viperfolk alchemist. He came from [[Ngamui Isles]], and soon gained a reputation as the most lethal poisoner in all the land: His toxins were deadly in a variety of ways. Some hypnotized, some paralyzed, some killed slowly and some quickly. And apparently no evidence ever came back to him, but he also kept a low profile.

-The fifth was [[Horionvill]] "The Redeemer", firefolk witch. She had built a small cult of [[Neverborn]] in the city, and they performed sadistic rituals. Her powerful spells allowed her to persuade anyone to do penances and litanies, and she gradually gained great influence in several wizarding circles.
