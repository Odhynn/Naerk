A group of influential individuals that took over [[Khalaram]] during the 48th century. At first they exploited [[King Hawlfeyth]]'s favor to expand their influence and later they slowly became independent from the countries' authorities and started ruling [[Khalaram]] and its suburbs on their own.
The five most influentian members are supposed to be:

 -[[Zeith Gyr]], a cunning aristocrat.
 -[[Matthen]] Bluntnose, a giant half-orc.
 -[[Kalar Gyr]] daughter of Zeith and vigilante.
 -[[Hurdali Khamarnaya]], a Viperfolk alchemist.
 - [[Horionvill]] "The Redeemer", a firefolk witch.
