The pirates of [[Naerk]] were a constant threat to noble traders, but their power was slowly but steadily increased after the formation of [[Palaurim]] and the establishment of the wealthy South Trade Route. Pirates were becoming numerous in [[Markesh]] and northeast [[Zelgerosh]] and started organized attacks in the last centuries. They spread to the west, with attacks on [[Whistor]] ships and shores.
