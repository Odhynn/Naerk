## Description

The pirates of [[Naerk]] were a constant threat to noble traders, but their power was slowly but steadily increased after the formation of [[Palaurim]] and the establishment of the wealthy South Trade Route. Pirates were becoming numerous in [[Markesh]] and northeast [[Zelgerosh]] and started organized attacks in the last centuries. They spread to the west, with attacks on [[Whistor]] ships and shores.

The Pirate Council traditionally takes place in the historical [[Plunder Town]] and has seats, which also define the corresponding sphere of influence of each Pirate Lord in which he has absolute power. Many years may pass before the Council is reassembled, but in no case does this mean that it loses its supervision or its powers. It assigns a flag to each Pirate Lord, with several adjustments for the subjects of the respective lord. The seats, and their current holders are:

1) [[Cleitas Sea]]: Chief [[Ungu]] Karauna, Flag: Tribal Whale Tail.
2) [[Palaurim|South Trade Route]]: Lady [[Della]], Flag: Demonskull with Roses in Eyeholes.
3) [[Agisor Sea]]: Captain [[Semane]] Daya, Flag: Crossed Skeletal Hands with Jatagans.
4) [[Whalelands]]: Jarl Hraflang Valkra, Flag: Narwal Skeleton with Tentacles.
5) [[Alagon]] Sea: Captain [[Sibayang]], Flag: Hook in a Heart.
6) [[Stormfall]]: Lord [[Ferran]], Flag: Flaming Skull.
7) [[Bj√•glant]]: Jarl [[Eykk]], Flag: Bearded Skull with Crossed Axes and runes on Forehead.
8) [[Brown Sea]]: Captain [[Jason]] Gollan, Flag: Anchor below a Wolf Head.
9) [[Skator Sea]]: Captain [[Nysvilthrix]], Flag: Winged Coffin.
10) [[Meeran Gulf]]: Smuggler [[Sethayasar]], Flag: Bull's Head with Eyes like a Woman's Breast.
11) [[Raglyu Gulf]]: Captain [[Denali]] Vishatarya, Flag: Painted Tiger Head.
12) [[Flame Gulf]]: Captain [[Valus]], Flag: Jester Hat in Trident.

## South Sea Pirate Codex

This is the Pirate Codex of the pirates of [[Whistor]], the [[Flame Gulf]], and the Southern Trade Route:

**-Part of the Ship, Part of the Crew.** Everyone on board the ship is considered part of the crew. In any other case, they are treated as an enemy, intruder or booty (slave). All crew members are obliged to contribute to the defence and management of the ship.

**-Part of the Crew, Part of the Loot.** The loot belongs to the entire crew and is shared equally.

**-Head of the Ship, Head of the Crew.** The captain of the ship is also responsible for the fate of the crew.

**-Head of the Fleet, Head of the Ship.** The captain of the fleet is also responsible for each independent ship that consists the fleet.

**-Part of the Crew, Weapon in Hand.** All crew members are obliged to fight wherever and whenever necessary.

**-Gold with Blood. Disloyalty with Death.** Theft, whether of booty or gambling, is punished severely and brutally. Treason and desertion lead to even more severe punishments, all of which result in death.

**-Left the Crew, Left to the Sea.** Any other act that results in removal of crew membership means immediate disembarkation from the ship.

**-Part of the Crew beyond Death.** The crew remains loyal to death and beyond. Their secrets, service, and trust continue beyond any obstacle.

**-Crew Dispute, End on Spot.** Disputes are resolved immediately, violently if necessary, and are not repeated.

**-Captain Kill, First on Loot.** Whoever kills the captain of an enemy ship gets the first share of the loot.

**-First Kill, Second on Loot.** Whoever kills the first enemy ship's sailor gets the second share of the loot.

**-First to Spot, Third on Loot.** Whoever spots an enemy ship first gets the third share of the loot.

**-Bound to the Ship, Chained on the Shore.** Crew identity does not begin or end on the ship, but extends to periods of looting, disembarking, or relaxing on shore.
