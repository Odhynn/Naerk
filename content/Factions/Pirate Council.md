The pirates of [[Naerk]] were a constant threat to noble traders, but their power was slowly but steadily increased after the formation of [[Palaurim]] and the establishment of the wealthy South Trade Route. Pirates were becoming numerous in [[Markesh]] and northeast [[Zelgerosh]] and started organized attacks in the last centuries. They spread to the west, with attacks on [[Whistor]] ships and shores.

The Pirate Council traditionally takes place in the historical [[Plunder Town]] and has seats, which also define the corresponding sphere of influence of each Pirate Lord in which he has absolute power. Many years may pass before the Council is reassembled, but in no case does this mean that it loses its supervision or its powers. It assigns a flag to each Pirate Lord, with several adjustments for the subjects of the respective lord. The seats, and their current holders are:

1) [[Cleitas Sea]]: Chief [[Ungu]] Karauna, Flag: Tribal Whale Tail.
2) [[Palaurim|South Trade Route]]: Lady [[Della]], Flag: Demonskull with Roses in Eyeholes.
3) [[Agisor Sea]]: Captain [[Semane]] Daya, Flag: Crossed Skeletal Hands with Jatagans.
4) [[Whalelands]]: Jarl Hraflang Valkra, Flag: Narwal Skeleton with Tentacles.
5) [[Alagon]] Sea: Captain [[Sibayang]], Flag: Hook in a Heart.
6) Stormfall: Lord Ferran, Flag: Flaming Skull.
7) Bj√•glant: Jarl Eykk, Flag: Bearded Skull with runes on Forehead in Crossed Axes.
8) Brown Sea: Captain Jason Gollan, Flag: Anchor with Wolf Head.
9) Skator Sea: Captain Nysvilthirx, Flag: Winged Coffin.
10) Meeran Gulf: Smuggler Sethayasar, Flag: Bull's Head, Eyes like Woman's Breast.
11) Raglyu Gulf: Captain Denali Vishatarya, Flag: Painted Tiger Head.
12) [[Flame Gulf]]: Captain Valus, Flag: Jester Hat in Trident.
