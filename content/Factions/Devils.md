The ex-[[Kenemi]] that followed [[Sergonial]] after his Speech of Defiance to the creation of [[Hell]]. Vicious, Cruel and Militaristic, devils follow Sergonial's Tenets with twisted devotion. Their ranks are renewed constantly by the dead [[Kenorex]], by those who make deals with devils and sell their soul, and by those loyal to the Scrolls of the Supreme Tyrrant. The devils obey a strict hierarchy in their ranks and everyone knows his position in hell. Sometimes, devils are summoned or called in the [[Material Plane]] to help the Kenorex armies or the Clergy of Sergonial, and in some cases, to do the biding of a mortal that made a deal with them.
