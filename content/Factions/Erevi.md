## Origin

[[Amehan]] and his titans sculpted the remains of the [[Demons]] and [[Devils]] from the [[Eternal Slaughter]] into a hideous and bloodthirsty army: the first [[Vulga]], made by his own hands, and the [[Erevi]], created by the Titans. Each species presented his own particular approach of violence, corruption and destruction on his warriors. And by the time the Eternal Slaughter ended, their army was ready. The very first Erevi were the Titans themselves, powerful primordial beings of origins unknown that sweared fealty to Amehan's cause.
