In Paraselt there are two distinct centers of power, which come from two different sources: The first, the giants, and the second, the goblins.

The Fire Giants are divided into two main factions: The Rall faction, based in the mansions of [[Ral'Zoton]], and the Dragonfire faction based in the [[Kegrozal]] volcano.

Goblins at the same time have three main strongholds: [[Kundurak]], [[Kaygesh]] and the Lavahead tribe with the [[Defeated Army]].

These five distinct parts of the Paraselt in times of need draw up a council of war about how to defend the mountains or how to fight a neighbor, but on rare occasions they also meet to settle their differences, mainly about the borders between them. They are represented matriarchically by their most powerful and wise warrior women. The council is called Magma Star, because it is made on a table like a five-pointed star, from magma, made inside a Volcano, in a secret location.

The first convergence of the Magma Star was from the time the Vulga attacked the [[Material Plane]] and opened a Portal, in the year -1275 with [[The Eruption]]. This council has been called upon to make important decisions in the past, as well as in the present, both regarding the [[Defeated Army]] and for the recent [[Palaurim]] attack. They also organised the [[Battle of the Gap]].
