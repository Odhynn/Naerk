In Paraselt there are two distinct centers of power, which come from two different sources: The first, the giants, and the second, the goblins.

The Fire Giants are divided into two main factions: The Rall faction, based in the mansions of [[Ral'Zoton]], and the Dragonfire faction based in the [[Kegrozal]] volcano.

The former consider themselves the true descendants of the southern Sun Giants and do not recognize any stronger in the mountains. Their power is terrifying, yet they have centuries to attack southern Oromil. They have established trade relations with Hoarinhel, and export metals, weapons and rare gems. Their power is immense and their city is imposing and vast in size.

The latter are much more irritable. They had previously attacked Tithlon many times, running behind Kegrozal's blasts, and wreaking havoc on the elves and half-elves of the area. They had a close alliance and cooperation with the dragons of the region, but when the eldest of them, Solusmeir, along with his son Emberspark died in an attack on Ilystair in the year 4777, they took the opportunity to subjugate the Bloodscales and kobolds of the region . Since then their attacks on Tithlon have multiplied and the territory they conquer increases every month.

Goblins at the same time have three main strongholds.

 Kundurak, built by cyclops, is the main reason trade in Vhuluriin Bay is so dangerous. They have infinite small boats that can move quickly and mount armies of goblins on much larger ships, while their war engines are huge and throw alchemical fire, which burns ships at great distance.

Kaygesh's city is for some of the greatest goblins in Na'erk. From this point they have a huge range in the mountains and there are often rivalries with the gnolls and werewolves in the Teilkan Fields.

Finally, in the north there is the tribe of Lavaheads in the north. Their battles with the Green Hills go way back in history, but the Green Hills never managed to invade Paraselt. It is rumored that parts of the Defeated army are also located here, and that they have even taken positions of power and are moving the strings.

These five distinct parts of the Paraselt in times of need draw up a council of war about how to defend the mountains or how to fight a neighbor, but on rare occasions they also meet to settle their differences, mainly about the borders between them. They are represented matriarchically by their most powerful and wise warrior women. The council is called Magma Star, because it is made on a table like a five-pointed star, from magma, made inside a Volcano, in a secret location.

The first convergence of the Magma Star was from the time the Vulga attacked the material dimension and opened a Portal, in the year -1275 with the Eruption. This council has been called upon to make important decisions in the past, as well as in the present, both for the Defeated Army and for the recent Palaurim attack.
