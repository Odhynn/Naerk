The captains and soldiers of [[Veiroch]]. These [[Devils]] are very cruel and sadistic, with strict orders and command structure. Some of them are even other outsiders, usually demons, that were captured and forced to serve after severe torment. They focus on punishing those who fall astray from their orders and enforcing discipline amongst the devil ranks. They are feared by most of the other devils, and for good reason. They inhabit the [[Red Corner]] in [[Hell]], a place of constant suffering and torment.

The Painbringers have quite a few followers in the [[Material Plane]] as well, each one more twisted than the next, even by Kenorex standards. Some are executioners, others torturers, others rapists and sadists. What is even more terrible is that in many places there are entire enclaves with connections to the respective authorities of each region who operate underground and offer their services in intimidation, information and persuasion as they please for a corresponding payment. And finally, it goes without saying that where the [[Kenorex]] gain power, correspondingly the Painbringers are given the task of enforcing the law, dispensing justice, and the "committee of inquiry" that sees, hears, and judges each act accordingly.
