In the uncharted area between [[Firindel]] and [[Krelien]], lies lake [[Molien]], unknown to most. On its shores, the first Gathering of the Druids of [[Edhelwood]], also known as Sylvanaya, was to be held in the year 27. Not long after the [[Ghost War]], [[Edhelwood]] became home to nymphs, centaurs, and satyrs for the first time. The first meeting had more of a character of reconciliation and management of the individual areas, but soon it tackled very important issues.

These had to do with druidic magic, the way some magical effects got out of control within the forest, and how the magic of the ancient [[Edhellin]] could be put to productive use. Sacred groves were designated, which had to remain secret because of the powerful magic that took place there. Soon, the druids discovered a unique fact: The reason the magical effects were being distorted and out of control was because in certain places, there were huge trees of Volrek, the [[Rezal]], that since the time of the Edhellin communicated with the [[Leylines]] of [[Tarov]] underground, as their roots reached very deep into the ground.

Once they realized this, they decided to guard this discovery. Thus guardians of each such tree were appointed, who were called [[Vel Rezal]]. At the same time, the druids forced the elves and forest creatures to limit their teleportation to a sufficient distance from the Rezals, and only the Vel Rezals gained the right to unrestricted use of magic within these areas. In total, 34 Rezal were mapped in Edhelwood and an equal number of guardians were assigned, each calling on various friends and acquaintances for help.

Since then, the Gathering of Sylvanaya has taken the preservation of those trees very seriously. Any elf who enters sacred territory, either unintentionally or on purpose, has the choice of either devoting the rest of his life to the service of Vel Rezal, or having all memory of the event erased by drinking water from Molien. This was also why the Gathering agreed to help the wood elves against [[Hithlwin]]'s invasion of the southeast. The possibility of strangers entering the forest and in their longing for power to use the power of the trees or vandalize them was something that united all druids and forest creatures. Since then, there has been a permanent Sylvanaya force in the castles of [[Vel Khara]] and [[Vel Nozhiel]], while natural barriers were set up in case of invasion and include the entire southern part of the forest.
