This Order was founded mostly secretly by [[Melissa]] Ragas in order to be able to protect the libraries from organised thief attacks and to be able to expose them. The first gathering took place in the year 4812 and was called the Order of the Scroll. With the help of the priests of [[Hansa]], [[Sigard]], [[Nahema]] and various librarians, the extent of the text losses was soon recorded, exceeding a hundred pieces. At the same time, within a few years, the Order of the Scroll had grown to over eight hundred in number, with many of their agents located in almost every major city in Palaurim.
