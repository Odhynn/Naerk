In 2427 the tribe fought several battles against the expansion of [[Dal'Vorag]] in [[Norfol]] when the latter wanted to expand into the lowlands of the river. After fierce fighting, the Baldosh managed to stop the Dal'Vorag with the help of the [[Arlas]], but not before they had lost large areas, which the Wise Dragon's tribe never managed to regain.
