## Origin

In the year 3492, shortly after the founding of the [[Cornuzel]], it was discovered that in the [[Azarak]] academy, reckless use of magic was not viable. Following the collapse of a tower on Azarak after a vain apprentice wizard attempted to transform the stone, it became clear to the Cornuzel Dream Council that the use and learning of spells had to be done with due caution. The dream session lasted for many hours and was very tense and decided as follows:

_"Our Academy, after yesterday's incident, feels obliged to emphasize that magic is NOT dangerous, only its users can be, both for those around them and for themselves. A proper mage is not only able to subordinate magic to his will, but in order to achieve this, he must necessarily know the possibilities and dangers of its use. It is therefore obvious to us that in addition to knowing spells, curses and rituals, he must also know when, where and how to use them and when not. Magic is a power without limits and for this very reason every mage bears the responsibility to know which aspects of it he is allowed to touch and which ones he is not."_

This decision was accompanied by three lists of spells. The first concerned apprentice mages and restricted the use of their spells only in the presence of a teacher. The spells on the second list were completely forbidden to apprentices. Finally, the third list contained spells that were not allowed by anyone for any reason.

Twelve years later, this magical academy was flourishing at a tremendous pace and many believed that this was happening thanks to that decision. It was then that [[Arothal]] visited it for the first time and noticed [[Kleyton]]'s magical garden. It was a garden that through magic could make everything bloom at an increased rate regardless of season and climate, thanks to a spell made permanent by [[Legande]] Alhal, a member of the Dream Council. [[Arothal]] then said that he had come into contact with a druid named [[Raefibb]] and that he had told him that the spell could become very dangerous very quickly if he made it permanent. _"In just a few years, the fruits of this land will become toxic and the living things it buries become undead, he told me."_

Indeed, in less than a week, since he knew what to pay attention to in his study and before Arothal had even finished his visit, Legande was able to confirm the druid's words. Immediately, he broke the dangerous spell and the [[Cornuzel]], thanking Arothal, asked him how they could reciprocate. _"I've always believed that knowledge and experience should be accessible to everyone. You've already started a registry of dangerous spells to avoid potential problems, but following your example, other academies have started to do this. Not to mention so many wizards who have recorded who knows what in their personal books and when they meet [[Amehan]] they will take everything they know with them. I want to change this, I want any wizard in the world to know that, for example, it is dangerous to make a quick-bloom spell permanent."_

## Release

The Cornuzel listened carefully to Arothal and realized that if they succeeded in what he asked, their name would become famous throughout the world. At the same time, they also asked the opinion of [[Ashiro]], the powerful wizard and hero of [[Oventhart]]. So they began to record the prohibitions and restrictions of other academies and wizards. Very soon it became clear that if they wanted to make a list of what all wizards would have to report, then the distinction between apprentices and non-apprentices would have to cease. A few months later, in the spring of the year 3505, they released the book Principia Magicka, which had four lists of spells.

1. Wild Spells: this list contains spells that are accompanied by unpredictable consequences, under conditions or always.

2. Backlash Spells: this list contains spells that can cause harm to the user or those around them.

3. Restricted Spells: this list contains spells that can have devastating effects under certain circumstances.

4. Forbidden Spells: this list contains spells that have been forbidden in any case, as they have been deemed too dangerous to be used by anyone.

Over the years, the restrictions of Principia Magicka have been tested, both in [[Azarak]] academy, in [[Ansivaal]] and more widely in magic user circles, bringing desired results. The need for these restrictions was confirmed, as well as the need to expand them and constantly update them. After the rapid spread of its use in magic academies and wizard circles in every corner of [[Naerk]], its restrictions began to be adopted even by druid circles and the priesthood.

## Enforcement and Aphorati Arcanorum

Soon, many states began to take an interest in institutionalizing the limits it set and enforcing them. Starting with [[Reisdok]] and then [[Kultaria]], by order of each palace, magic users were obliged to consult the Principia Magicka and not violate its precepts. In many cases, penalties ranging from fines to death were applied. In Reisdok, a special unit was established to find and punish violators and became an integral part of the guard: the Aphorati Arcanorum.

The next to follow this trend were the leadership of the [[Dragonpact]], the [[Gatewatch]] and for a short time the [[Demonslavers]] from [[Olgizmar]]. Countries like [[Edhelwood]] and New [[Oventhart]], which had a strong elven presence and extensive experience in the destructive power of magic, enriched their existing legal frameworks with the principles set forth in the Principia Magicka. In contrast, the Principia Magicka was rejected as a heresy in [[Xe'Farom]], its supporters were persecuted and any copies that reached there were burned. Many witches from [[Twilight Veil]] also refused to apply it.

Over the years, the Principia Magicka was adopted by the countries north of Kultaria and then [[Imtaria]] all the way to the southern shores of the [[Angry Sea]]. This process culminated when it was declared, at the founding of [[Palaurim]], that each member state had an obligation to ensure that the principles it set forth were not violated within its borders and to punish anyone who did so.

To this day, Principia Magicka is constantly being updated and reissued in newer editions.
