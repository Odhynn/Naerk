## Description

A mercenary group consisting primarily of cavalry from nomads. Gheren Steed are known as fierce warriors and merciless, and they are not always loyal to the one they swore to fight for. In their ranks are humans, half orcs and centaurs.

## History

 They chose to avoid taking part in [[Battle of Fellgaunt]]. Their horses couldn't maneuver in the city, but most believed it was because they wanted to be on the winner's good side. Many of them converted to [[Karadosh]] when the priest [[Voldrak]] became their leader afterwards and raided the countryside. On his death, [[Delhan Poglu]] took the reigns of command and restored [[Rotting]] as second-in-command.
