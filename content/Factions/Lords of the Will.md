A secret organization of powerful mages that are thought to influence important events in ways unseen by most. It is said they are allies of [[Yerastu]].

They kept under their protection the [[Eye of Veth]]. When it was stolen by unknown thieves that gave it to the winter witch [[Tayra]], it caused the [[Winter's War]].
