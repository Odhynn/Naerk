## Description

Crimson Steel are widely known to be around for perhaps more than three millennia. It is not known exactly when and how they were created, as this remains one of the infinite mysteries that time has buried, with only guesses being the unions of three or more corresponding orders or the intervention of superior beings and/or demons for its creation. However, it is certain that it has directly influenced the development of [[Naerk]]'s history.

## History

Their order in the past resembled a strict palace structure, vertical staffing and hierarchy. Their motives remain unknown to most, but they are certainly responsible for countless murders, robberies, thefts and sabotages, most notable examples being the theft of one of the [[Solarium Ring|Rod of Stone and Steel rings]] from the [[Sapphire Temple]] and the assassination of the former king of Arbader, [[King Laorwick II|Laorwick II]].

About a millennium ago the Order of the Cave was created, with many of the powerful Steel as leaders, who saw their position as a mismatch to their power. Among them the [[Lady of Pain]] and [[Zinziglum]]. The battle between the two took place on two main levels, in terms of potential and networks. The struggle lasted some five centuries, and ended when at the zenith of the conflict the Steel seemed to be victorious with enormous losses, while the Order was almost wiped out.

Then, they came to an agreement. The Steel are reunited, with an undisputed leader (or Darkh as they call him, as his real name is lost upon taking office), who has the ability to issue whatever orders he wants at will. The Order continued to operate with relative autonomy. Thus, four chiefs are seated, below the leader, along with his right hand. A leader from the Cave, two Crimson, and a position open to anyone, now occupied by the Lady of Pain. The four leaders are staffed by the most capable people in there, since every time a position opens up anyone who wants to risk their life can claim it. They, along with the leader's right-hand man, constitute the highest body of the Steel, following the leader's word and deciding by vote on matters not resolved by the leader. Instead of voting, decisions are rarely made "on corpses", that is, if any of the five chooses, they can choose to defend their vote with their lives against anyone who has a different opinion. "On corpses," the Lady of Pain has decided more times than anyone.

In recent years, Crimson Steel became active in [[Oventhart]] for unknown reasons.
