An ancient tribe of the north that arrived from the southwest [[Walrus Shores]] and took active part in the [[Siege of Hlafengrond]]. After the siege, they wanted no part in the war between the tribes and found their place in the northeast after a long journey. During their travels, a part of them split and formed the first members of [[Dohjil]] tribe.
