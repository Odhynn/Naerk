The Lampsir tribe, famous for its archers, derived from the [[Skra]] tribe after several enmities and rivalries between hunters and families. The turning point was the end of the [[Siege of Hlafengrond]], where the most bold of the tribe attacked the [[Kalenvad]] warriors. The Lampsir left them, moved to the south and since then faced many assaults from the Steady Hand, including a [[Wedding Sacriledge]] and a land feud for the south shores of the [[Furbung]] lake, in which they sent Bolka [[Falgyrd]] to the events known as [[Murder Hawk and Linnorm Hunter Saga]].
