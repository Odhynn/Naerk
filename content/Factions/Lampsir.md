The Lampsir tribe, famous for its archers, derived from the [[Skra]] tribe after several enmities and rivalries between hunters and families. They moved to the south and since then faced many assaults from the Steady Hand, including a [[Wedding Sacriledge]] and a land feud for the south shores of the [[Furbung]] lake, in which they sent Bolka [[Falgyrd]] to the events known as [[Murder Hawk and Linnorm Hunter Saga]].
