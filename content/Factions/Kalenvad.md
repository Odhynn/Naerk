An ancient tribe of the north that arrived from southwest and took active part in the [[Siege of Hlafengrond]]. As they arrived first in the siege and ensuing battle, they claimed [[Hlafengrond]] after the giants' defeat as their own. Many tribes condemned this action as selfish. Some [[Skra]] warriors attacked them, to no avail.
