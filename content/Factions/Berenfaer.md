## Description

Berenfaer is a secret organization originally formed to fight for freedom in western [[Oventhart]] against the tyrranical armies of [[Kenorex]] from [[kambah]]. They rallied many insurgents near the border and waged guerilla warfare. They were eventually stopped and hunted down by the disciplined army of [[Karahath]]. They reappeared to abolish slavery in [[Zolkar]] and nearby areas. Soon, their influence grew after [[Zolkar's Dawn Riot]] and they started participating in Zolkar's politics and inspiring rebellions in other regions.

## Origins

If one asks the historians or the analysts, one will hear of merchants. Since the 36th century, small-fry businessmen and peddlers in [[Zolkar]] and the northwest coast of [[Karrokh]] developed a habit of banding together in low-profile associations to protect their interests and the interests of their respective communities against the surge of piracy and those who wielded greater power, whether political, social or fiscal. They answered thievery with thievery, discreetly and conservatively, always in ways that ensured their staying off the spotlight while keeping their people from going hungry. Over time those widespread guilds were consolidated into networks of differing mindsets yet mutual interests. Thus the late 40th century and the end of the hostilities in [[Karrokh]] saw what was now known as the Berenfaer firmly established in their home turf, yet unwilling to branch out towards the rest of the world. They have since receded or progressed in sudden leaps, whether that means disappearing for centuries and rumoured to be disbanded, or overthrowing a long-standing slaver state in a matter of months and immediately sticking their noses in the affairs of other nations.

If one asks the storytellers, one shall hear tales of bravery and sacrifice. Stories speak of a charismatic elf that went by the name of Berenfaer (allegedly meaning "a soul most bold" in ancient elven, pronounced be-ren-FA-er) who roamed the land, who fought and plotted in shadow and light to undermine villainous nobles and bloodthirsty tyrants, who cared for the common man and asked for nothing in return but a place by the fire. There are many variations of the tale, but all culminate in the heroic death of Berenfaer against the backdrop of the Karokhi Wars. The epilogue recounts his closest comrades being asked, by passers-by or by family or by torturers "Where is Berenfaer?", only to reply "I am Berenfaer".

As with all things, the truth must lie somewhere in the middle.
