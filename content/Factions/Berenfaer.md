## Description

Berenfaer is an organization of freedom fighters and operatives that combat slavery and tyranny. Their presence was low-key and sporadic before the [[Zolkar's Dawn Riot]], when they managed to outright abolish slavery in [[Zolkar]] and become the leading faction at its helm.
Invigorated by their success, newfound power, and an influx of talent among their ranks, they quickly branched out beyond the shores of Zolkar, establishing contacts and safe houses in multiple regions where resistance against authoritarian rule and human trafficking is budding.

This led to their duality as a political force to be reckoned with in the diplomatic sphere of Palaurim, and a secret agency that operates from the shadows well beyond its territories.

> Since the 36th century, small-fry businessmen and peddlers in [[Zolkar]] and the northwest coast of [[Karrokh]] developed a habit of banding together in low-profile associations to protect their interests and the interests of their respective communities against the surge of piracy and those who wielded greater power, whether political, social or fiscal.
> They would answer to thievery with thievery, discreetly and cautiously, always in ways that ensured their staying off the spotlight while keeping their people from going hungry. Over time those widespread guilds were consolidated into networks of differing mindsets yet mutual interests. Thus the late 40th century and the end of the hostilities in [[Karrokh]] saw what was now known as the Berenfaer firmly established in their home turf, yet unwilling to branch out towards the rest of the world. They have since receded or progressed in sudden leaps, whether that means disappearing for centuries and rumoured to be disbanded, or overthrowing a long-standing slaver state in a matter of months and immediately sticking their noses in the affairs of other nations.
> - Another account maintains that the Berenfaer were originally formed to fight for freedom in western [[Oventhart]] against the tyrranical armies of [[Kenorex]] from [[Kambah]], rallying many insurgents near the border to wage guerilla warfare, only to be eventually stopped and hunted down by the disciplined army of [[Karahath]].

> If one asks the storytellers, one shall hear tales of bravery and sacrifice. Stories speak of a charismatic elf that went by the name of Berenfaer (allegedly meaning "a soul most bold" in ancient elven, pronounced be-ren-FA-er) who roamed the land, who fought and plotted in shadow and light to undermine villainous nobles and bloodthirsty tyrants, who cared for the common man and asked for nothing in return but a place by the fire. There are many variations of the tale, but all culminate in the heroic death of Berenfaer against the backdrop of the Karokhi or Oventhartan Wars. The epilogue recounts his closest comrades being asked, by passers-by or by family or by torturers "Where is Berenfaer?", only to reply "_I am_ Berenfaer".

## Structure

The Berenfaer consist of an array of operatives spread across Naerk. To preserve the security protocols, they refer to each other by their agent nicknames and operate within regional cells that have only as much contact with the rest of the Berenfaer as is deemed safe by the higher layer of handlers and comms agents.

The leadership itself is based in Zolkar, and consists of the assembly of spymasters, accomplished operatives who take on the strategic and supportive duties.
The spymasters have roles that range from political direction to undercover oversight, and are tasked with making sure that the operative network remains decentralised and individual cells have enough support when taking the initiative in their own regions.

The most influential spymasters include:
- [[Steelshade]], councillor and political face of the Berenfaer and Elestair, holding one of the two seats of Zolkar in the Council of [[Palaurim]]; he is credited with reviving the Berenfaer by spearheading the Zolkar's Dawn riots
- [[Black Mist]], head of intelligence and master spy, a vigilante with multiple identities and sharpshooter
- Banshee, head analyst and cultural face of the Berenfaer, a powerful arcanist and muse of Elestair; coming into the fold after rescuing Steelshade in Hashnev, she is credited with spearheading the security protocol reforms
- Teucer, captain of the scouts and sharpshooter
- Ajax, captain of the guard and ferocious axeman

Beyond a multitude of clandestine safehouses in foreign territories, the Berenfaer maintain a few formal strongholds on Zolkar, the most prominent being the castles of Pegasus Keep (overlooking Elestair) and Fort Freyr (along the coastline of Ilistair).
Fort Freyr was captured from a major slave trader during the riots in the winter of 4817, while Pegasus Keep was magically constructed during the next summer by Banshee, with inhabitants coming to marvel at the carpentry and masonry flying into place as she sung and played on her harp.
