## History

Berenfaer is a secret organization originally formed to fight for freedom in western [[Oventhart]] against the tyrranical armies of [[Kenorex]] from [[kambah]]. They rallied many insurgents near the border and waged guerilla warfare. They were eventually stopped and hunted down by the disciplined army of [[Karahath]].

 They reappeared to abolish slavery in [[Zolkar]] and nearby areas. Soon, their influence grew after [[Zolkar's Dawn Riot]] and they started participating in Zolkar's politics and inspiring rebellions in other regions.
