## History

The year 4632 was marked as a year of constant warfare in the Green Hills. The reason was the continuous attacks of goblins, hobgoblins, bugbears and trolls from [[Paraselt]]. The cities of [[Ostrauit]] and [[Dargonast]] faced sieges, and the region's vast expanses allowed the goblins to utilise most of their endless warriors. Ostrabit was blocked, and Dargonast was about to fall.

[[King Timmon III]] of Ostrabit's general at that time was [[Baelard]], who had a reputation as a unique swordsman. Baelard was particularly hard pressed as he was outnumbered in combat and not very good at strategy and maneuvering in battle. He was beginning to believe that in a few weeks both cities would fall. He therefore decided to change his strategy.

He conversed with an elven priest from [[Edhelwood]], who was trapped there. The elf, also known as [[Erothel]], had a reputation as one of the best trapmakers and necromancers in all the land. The elf agreed to help him, if in exchange he would take the souls of all those who died in battle. Baelard was pressed and decided to accept, although he had no idea what Erothel would do with the souls of the dead and he did not like the idea at all. So he asked him to carve magical runes into a dozen weapons that would make them more lethal and as many armors to make them invulnerable to attacks. At the same time, he sculpted protective glyphs on many parts of the inner wall. Erothel worked nonstop for three weeks, until the day the goblins prepared for their final invasion.

In the morning, the goblins attacked from all sides and literally flooded the wall. The resistance of the few defenders was meager and they soon captured the outer wall. As they advanced, they encountered a few warriors and inhabitants alike, until they reached the inner wall that protected the tower, which was twenty feet high. This appeared to be manned with a dozen warriors. The goblins rushed in screaming and began to climb.

What followed was carnage. One after the other, the traps were activated. All around the perimeter of the walls, explosions of fire engulfed dozens of goblins, while elsewhere they collapsed dead from necromancy upon touching the wall, their life energy leaving them. Elsewhere, they fell down and screamed in pain, while in some places electrical discharges and sonic booms were thrown. Within minutes, thousands of goblins met their death.

But this was only the vanguard. The next wave literally found ladder ready from the corpses of his fellow warriors in many places, and gradually the runes lost their magic as they were covered by the corpses and released their power. Then the goblins relentlessly climbed the wall, and came face to face with the twelve armored warriors. Among them was Baelard himself, who had chose one by one twelve from the most elite fighters at his disposal. The goblins could not penetrate their armor with any weapon at their disposal, their blades sucking the life out of the goblins' bodies. The battle lasted a long time, but the warriors slaughtered with unabated intensity, enhanced by the priest's magic. They retreated only to avoid being covered by their dead opponents.

The battle lasted three days. For three days, almost non-stop, the warriors and traps killed constantly. In the end the warriors were buried under a swarm of goblins and one after another died heroically. Then, from the central tower came a storm of arrows at the goblins gathered on the walls. All the survivors had taken bows and were shooting arrows, causing their dense formations to break up. The dead were already in the thousands, and the goblins were forced to retreat before the new threat.

Erothel walked alone among the dead, as no warrior dared to step outside the tower. The smell of the dead was unbearable, a stench of endless rot and decay. Vultures were beginning to gather, ready for the peck, and the screams of dying and wounded goblins echoed everywhere. Then Erothel began to hover above the battlefield on the walls and began to chant in a heavy and slow voice. No one dared to stop him. He raised his hand and held out a diamond. One by one, the souls began to leave the bodies of the dead and be absorbed by the diamond, which began to darken from red. A blue cloud of souls soon began to swirl around Erothel as they waited their turn to enter the diamond. In the end, absolute silence reigned. The diamond had turned pitch black.

The power in Erothel's hands was immense. He could do many powerful magical effects with it. To create an army of undead, to build a palace, to become king, to become immortal: the possibilities swirled in his head, and the diamond glowed with promise. He decided that he owed a debt to those who looked up to him, and he had admired the self-sacrifice of warriors. He knew he would be sacrificing a bright future.

He climbed down the walls and summoned an invisible force that removed the corpses that had plastered the nearest warrior. His body was deformed and mutilated by countless blows and wounds. Slowly, he touched the diamond on his forehead and said a prayer. Gradually the wounds began to close and the warrior came back to life. The residents stared wide-eyed, unable to believe the sight unfolding before them. Erothel repeated the process with the others, and gradually the diamond grew brighter, while he himself began to sweat, limp, and stumble with fatigue. In the end, when he managed to resurrect Baelard he fell down, his skin starting to rot from the amount of life and death magic he had used.

## Formation

It didn't take long for Baelard and his resurrected warriors to become heroes throughout the land. The mere sight of the warriors on the walls was enough to drive goblins away from the Green Hills for decades. Baelard then decided that with this magic and a small but disciplined body of warriors he could have great results, and sought Erothel's help. He was grateful for his choice, and gave him the nickname Deathwhisperer.

The following year the Baelarch were created. An organization of elite warriors, who, with the help of the priest, procured the best possible equipment, and undertook the protection of the [[Green Hills]]. The Baelarchs gained great fame in other regions as well, and their exploits multiplied in the years to come. They are famous for their magical weapons and armor, which help them defy death and tame it. However, at the same time, they also gained notoriety for dabbling in necromancy and using unethical means to win their battles.
