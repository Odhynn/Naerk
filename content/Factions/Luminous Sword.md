[[Laerion]]'s order, also known as the Luminous Order, first appeared in [[Green Hills]] when the goblin attacks from [[Paraselt]] began in the year 3125. It was originally formed in [[Dargonast]], where it was embraced by a large portion of the town's population. Later, it was extended to other cities, such as [[Ostrabit]], where the highest authority of the priesthood and the order was transferred there.

Not many months had passed, when an important dichotomy arose among the believers, which was to be decisive. With the first goblin attacks successfully repulsed, there was disagreement as to what the order's next steps should be.

The first opinion, mainly from priests and elders, said that they should devote themselves to improving the situation in Green Hills: Fighting corruption, improving the justice system, and rebuilding and developing the kingdom and fortifications. The second opinion, which was embraced by younger people, as well as by several who had lost their families and property, was to go on a campaign to Paraselt.

This disagreement could not be bridged, despite various meetings and discussions. Thus, a second battalion, the [[Luminous Sword]], was created, which began to recruit soldiers and villagers and moved to the border. They began recapturing new areas from the goblins south of the Green Hills, and with the help of the Luminous Order, these areas were manned, fortified, and an acritic army was created and settled there permanently. The Luminous Order, in agreement with the king, took care of the tax relief of these areas, and the fair distribution of the land. The warriors of the battalion occupied the entire west bank of the [[Roaring Strait]], and stopped only at the first hills of [[Paraselt]].

Luminous Sword in later decades expanded in other countries too. It especially resonated in [[Sunshine]] because the knights there gained access to dragon steeds, which they mounted and flew, after the agreement of [[Nentha]] and the [[Dragonpact]]. With their flying dragons, they began patrolling the islands and the [[Misty Sea]], slaying bandits, pirates, criminals, as well as gnolls to the east of [[Karrokh]]. In recent years they even stopped [[Kambah]] expansions.

The Luminous Sword, however, was not to be highly developed and massed in other regions. Today, there are headquarters in two other regions: [[Imtaria]] and northern [[Zolkar]]. It is characteristic, however, that Imtaria regards the Luminous Sword as overzealous fanatics who create trouble out of nowhere, even blaming them for [[Battle of the Gap|the defeat in the recent campaign at Paraselt]], for which they had an insignificant share of responsibility, given that they numbered two hundred warriors, that also sacrificed most of their number to allow other battalions to retreat in safety. Since then, there has been strong opposition in [[Palaurim]] over these issues and it is one of the reasons that [[Green Hills]] [[Green Hills: Focus Shift|seceded]] [[Palaurim]].
