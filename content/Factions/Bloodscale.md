A cult of dragons, kobolds, worshipers of [[Klemnestron]] and mutated humanÎ¿ids that openly defy [[Dragonpact]]. They includes a large number of ambitious humanoids who want to gain power quickly. Often they perform rituals with the blood or eggs of dragons that betrayed their kind (mostly those who accept the Dragonpact), and through these the servants gain unnatural power and abilities, from wings to deadly breath and scales. However they are few in number.
