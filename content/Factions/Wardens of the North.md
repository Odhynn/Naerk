After the [[Winter's War]] and the devastating effects of the [[Totem War]] throughout the North, it was deemed appropriate by some warriors who survived and took a leading role that there should be a permanent supervision of the menhirs, which should not fall within the responsibilities of the nearest tribes geographically, but should be a North-wide affair, precisely because of the extent of the disaster. To serve this purpose they proposed the formation of an inter-racial battalion with the sole purpose of guarding the Menhirs but also of surveillance - monitoring the entire North and gathering intelligence so that they could prevent anyone who would try to gain power from having any interaction with the Menhirs. This prudent purpose was initially welcomed by the regions bordering [[Hoss Glacier]], and many were found willing to join the ranks of the Order, from all possible backgrounds. Many saw a noble cause in keeping with the upheld ideals of the North, while also being an opportunity to escape misery and suffering and enjoy some recognition. Thus a critical mass of members was assembled mainly around the city of [[Tarful]] who formed this initiative and sent representatives throughout the North asking the various jarls as well as the people for support.

However, the other tribes did not respond as warmly to this call. Many saw it as a potential politico-military body intended to upset the balance between the tribes, while many, fearing espionage, were unwilling to share the secrets of their territory with outsiders. The [[Twilight Veil]] of [[Belgosreim]] in particular openly viewed it as a threat that would hinder their power. At [[Fervolosh]] it was treated with suspicion and not strongly supported but several tribes sent emissaries mainly to gain eyes and access for reasons of mutual rivalry. When they felt the threat upon them, several orcs from [[Fol'rish]] and [[No'Crel]] enlisted, the queen of [[Fol'rish]] even granted facilities in her territory within the city. As for the [[Hoen]] giants, although they were mot against the Order they did not recognize the need for such a cause and did not offer support. Thus after several efforts lasting years the order of Wardens of the North was formed in the year 3289 based at Vigil Keep on the western shores of Lake Upperbung. The first leader of the Order is believed to be Oleg Timberson who is said to be the grandson of the legendary Yoll Serok and the son of [[Finn]] “Flinger” Yolra.

Over time several warriors, as well as druids, wizards joined the Wardens and the power of the Order increased significantly. He set up several observatories and manned garrisons at various key points while adopting a model of semi-autonomous groups in [[Hoss Glacier]], [[Fervolosh]], [[Hlafentar]], while in [[Belgosreim]] a group of the toughest ones was secretly maintained as they were constantly rejected. However, this massification was also the main cause of the fall of the Order as it never managed to overcome the tribal enmities. While it was expressly forbidden under penalty of death for a military body of the Order to fight on the side of any tribe, its members individually could only fight on the side of their own tribe. This resulted in many wardens being at odds with each other and civil strife broke out within the Order itself, as many believed that there were individuals among them who violated the values ​​of the Order.

As the centuries passed and as the threat of the wendigo faded, so did the Wardens of the North decline. The various clans tried to exploit the various branches to their advantage, constantly bringing to an edge the confrontations within the Order. In the year 4453 the [[Vigil Keep]] was burned to the ground following a civil strife over the leadership of the Order and the Keep was abandoned. Gradually the order was forgotten and their function was more like the activity of a secret occult sect. Of course, there were those who even today try to recruit new members and continue their vigilance, but they are very few, with little means at their disposal, and few jarls nowadays offer them hospitality. The Hoss branch based in [[Fol'rish]] remained strong for quite some time, mainly because there the threat of the undead never ceased. However, after the [[Totem War]] where the wardens selflessly fought alongside the rest of the clans they were dealt a crushing blow and few remained.
