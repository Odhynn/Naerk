A [[Druids|Druid Circle]] in [[Athar]] hunting grounds. In their ranks there are a few hot-headed young adults or dogmatic ascetics who act independently within the circle and enjoy silent tolerance, or sometimes acceptance, even when their actions are hasty or inappropriate. Many believe that such spontaneous actions are completely natural and express their instinct, which is an expression of the [[Aspects]] themselves.
