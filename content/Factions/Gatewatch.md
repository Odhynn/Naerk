Gatewatch is mainly consisted of spellcasters. Their primary duty is to ensure that magic that creates Portals to other dimensions or calls in Outsiders is not misused or abused.

However, this task is not that simple. In various countries, such as in [[Whistor]], they are told to mind their own business, in the North their intervention was frowned upon, while in [[Karrokh]] those who went often mysteriously disappeared, while others were murdered. More than often, they often deal with apprentice sorcerers that can't control their power, causing them to summon creatures that defied their summoners' commands and spread death and terror over large areas. Even worse on rare occasions Gates would appear, bringing entire hordes of all manner of demons into the [[Material Plane]] until they closed, often with great innocent loss of life and Gatewatch personal sacrifice.
