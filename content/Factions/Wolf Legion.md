The warriors and Samurai of Lord [[Ishigaki]] of the Hida clan. After his exile from [[Sennarin]], they followed him in 46 ships as mercenaries and sailors. They distinguished themselves in many battles throughout the [[Lokkam Sea]] and even further south, in the [[Starlit Ocean]], [[Reisdok]] and even [[Whistor]], fighting nobly. Then they were called the [[Wolf Legion]], after the wolf of the Hida clan: And many warriors were enlisted among them, so that their strength was constantly renewed.

News of their whereabouts reached back to [[Sennarin]], and the Clans of Thunder. In the countryside and in the cities, whispers began to be made that they wanted revenge: All this reached the ears of Are, who was keeping half an eye on the Wolf Legion. Then, in the year 4801, assassins attacked the Hida clan exiles, killing several, with Ishigaki himself narrowly escaping death. No one knew the origin of the assassins, and lord Are denied any involvement in it. But the Wolf Legion broke into five separate divisions, which scattered across [[Reisdok]], [[Whistor]], [[Mestaxon]], [[Stormsfall]], and [[Nolgot]]. There they continued their mercenary work, but all the remaining of the original faction made a promise to meet again in twenty years and take revenge on the lord Are [[Shizou]], as they were now sure that he had sent the assassins.

Some of them took the responsibility of restoring order to the troubled city of [[Velaroya]] as mercenaries, with limited success.
