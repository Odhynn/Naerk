## Description

The Valor guard are the outsider allies and faithful servants of [[Sigard]] and [[Laerion]]. Those were knights, noble warriors or honourable figures in life, and in afterlife formed an elite outsider guard to promote the ideals of justice, honour and valor. They are winged or armored angels, shining bright and they fought in numerous wars. The Valor guard consists of two branches, the one who deals with manners of peace and one who deals with manners of war, representing the portfolio of Sigard and Laerion respectively.

## Notable Figures

 Their greatest generals since the beginning were [[Li-Tithlamir]], [[Lu-Meng]], [[Lo-Ukmasid]] and [[La-Vermenel]] that formed [[Le-Hara]] on their sacrifice. Among mortal servants, [[Hikari]] was an honorable samurai that eventually ascended.
