## [[Warclaw]]

The first werewolves were amongst the [[Warclaw]]. Creatures devoted to [[Karadosh]], the first of them fought alongside him in his first forays into towns and villages. But the Warclaw were doomed to be few, as the disease was only passed down from generation to generation. Furthermore, in order for a werewolf to ascend the hierarchy and gain absolute control over his form, one had to go through a series of trials and ceremonies that were particularly barbaric. However, their many victims were turning into mindless beasts, running on all fours, and reproducing rapidly. Often, the Warclaw recruited these beasts, creating armies that devastated large areas.

## [[Silvertail]]

[[Huntsman]]'s followers tried their best, but were unable to stop this scourge. The threat was spreading to the south and rangers, trackers and hunters were facing a huge danger as fighting was particularly frequent. Then, in a battle, one Warclaw, also known as [[Gerius]], was captured. Gerius was among the oldest and most powerful werewolves, and even possessed druidic powers. After much discussion among themselves, the Huntsman's followers decided that contracting the werewolf disease was the only way to defend the borderlands. They knew this choice would have huge consequences, but he could no longer see their own people slaughtered.

So, on a full moon day, a ceremony was held in the grove of a [[Rezal]] tree, in [[Edhelwood]]. A ceremony, in which Gerius was sacrificed, together with a wild wolf, and their blood was drunk by all present. And indeed, several of them acquired the power of lycanthropy, and then very selectively began to channel it in similar ceremonies. Thus, gradually, an elite group, also known as the [[Silvertail]], emerged and began to fight the Warclaw, thus curbing their destructive fury. The clash spread out in numerous regions, with variable results.

What still divides the sages today, is that the ceremony took place in a secret place: In a Rezal tree, which even had a guardian. The guardian stated that the ceremony was performed in his ignorance, and only a very powerful druid could bypass the protective barriers and perform the ceremony. Even today, this act is considered reprehensible in druid circles, and is one of the main reasons that despite their good intentions, the werewolves of Huntsman are often viewed with prejudice by elves and druids.

## Allyx

With the death of Gerius, many believed that one of the worst manifestations of lycanthropy had come to an end. But, despite those who believed so, Gerius survived after the ceremony of the Silvertails, the Huntsman's loyalists. On the next full moon his ghost rose and came out of his tomb. But he was no more a ghost: The reason he rose was the power of lycanthropy itself, which did not end with his death. His insatiable hunger and thirst for blood could not be stopped.

His spirit began to enter the bodies of local people as a host, and these in turn began to take on animal-like characteristics and display violent behavior and cannibalistic tendencies. Thus the spirit, sharing the senses of the body over which it had mastered, could again satisfy its hunger, since it itself had no physical substance. And spirits like this also appeared in other seemingly normal werewolves.

Apparently, this was something that took a long time for the [[Silvertail]], let alone the rest of the world, to understand. Initially, they thought that the symptoms presented by the victims were a classic case of lycanthropy, and they killed them on the spot: But often, several believed that it was some hereditary disease or a family issue: And this is because, the spirits carefully chose their victims. The result was that in some cases entire families were burned at the stake to "go away" from the evil, which rarely solved the problem. Sometimes, all the young people of a village were sacrificed, since the spirits preferred young victims and fresh flesh. The situation was getting out of hand, and the only culprit was a spirit: Allyx, as she was later named.

Fortunately for many, the occurrences of Allyx attacks were few and far between. Historically there have been less than twenty such cases, and even the best hunters, rangers, shamans and druids have no idea what exactly the conditions are that create them, though it never happens to Silvertail. The only way to destroy them that has certain results is to imprison the dead werewolf's soul: a particularly time-consuming and arduous process, even for the most powerful druids. And there are too many who feel that trapping a soul goes against physical balance, so it's almost never practiced.
