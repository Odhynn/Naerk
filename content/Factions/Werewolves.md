The first werewolves were amongst the [[Warclaw]]. Creatures devoted to [[Karadosh]], the first of them fought alongside him in his first forays into towns and villages. But the Warclaw were doomed to be few, as the disease was only passed down from generation to generation. Furthermore, in order for a werewolf to ascend the hierarchy and gain absolute control over his form, one had to go through a series of trials and ceremonies that were particularly barbaric. However, their many victims were turning into mindless beasts, running on all fours, and reproducing rapidly. Often, the Warclaw recruited these beasts, creating armies that devastated large areas.

[[Huntsman]]'s followers tried their best, but were unable to stop this scourge. The threat was spreading to the south and rangers, trackers and hunters were facing a huge danger as fighting was particularly frequent. Then, in a battle, one Warclaw, also known as [[Gerius]], was captured. Gerius was among the oldest and most powerful werewolves, and even possessed druidic powers. After much discussion among themselves, the Huntsman's followers decided that contracting the werewolf disease was the only way to defend the borderlands. They knew this choice would have huge consequences, but he could no longer see their own people slaughtered.

So, on a full moon day, a ceremony was held in the grove of a [[Rezal]] tree, in [[Edhelwood]]. A ceremony, by which Gerius was sacrificed, together with a wild wolf, and their blood was drunk by all present. And indeed, several of them acquired the power of lycanthropy, and then very selectively began to channel it in similar ceremonies. Thus, gradually, an elite group, also known as the [[Silvertail]], emerged and began to fight the Warclaw, thus curbing their destructive fury. The clash spread out in numerous regions, with variable results.

What still divides the sages today, is that the ceremony took place in a secret place: In a Rezal tree, which even had a guardian. The guardian stated that the ceremony was performed in his ignorance, and only a very powerful druid could bypass the protective barriers and perform the ceremony. Even today, this act is considered reprehensible in druid circles, and is one of the main reasons that despite their good intentions, the werewolves of Huntsman are often viewed with prejudice by elves and druids.
