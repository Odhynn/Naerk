A nomadic orc tribe that lives on tundra by hunting and foraging. They have an ancestral enmity with the [[Go'rokk]] and [[Ragaron]] tribes.

They attacked [[Clapten]] in 4736 awithout much success and repeated the attempt with aid from the [[Twilight Veil]] at 4740. This raid, secretly aided by the shaman spells, was a success and the tribe massacred many of the citizens and pillaged the town.
