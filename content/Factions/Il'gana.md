Il'ghana have a bad reputation amongst druid circles. They are mostly hermits that condemn civilization and domesticating animals. They have a violent history with attacks against desert settlements. Amongst their ranks, there are many [[Il'vec]] cultists from [[Locust Blight]]. They have an open enmity towards other [[Druids|Druid Circles]] that are friendly towards permanent settlements.
