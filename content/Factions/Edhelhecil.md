After the [[Edhelwood Invasion]], the great Edhellin civilization of the elves was crumbling. Some elves had begun digging underground burrows to escape at -1323. They began to build their civilization there having constant conflicts with all the clans that lived underground. Over the years their skin lost its brightness and their envy of the upper world grew steadily. They became constantly more violent and in less than three centuries they had lost most of their appearance and cultural characteristics. Their language was heavily influenced by the other races of the underground so that there are few common anymore with the rest of the elves. Their confinement underground led them to hate all the tribes that lived in the sunlight. Over time they were called dark elves or [[Edhelhecil]].
