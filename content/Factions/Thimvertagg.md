## History

The history of Thimvertagg dates back to almost the year 2500, when the nomadic tribes of the south, who lived in igloos and on ice, built ships that could cover long distances and carry several dozen warriors. Then, the barbarians of Thimvert began to trade and plunder other areas and this allowed them to grow and settle permanently in the port now known as [[Tublirk]] and the tribe was formed.

At first, raids barely reached the equator, but that was about to change suddenly. The events of [[Winter's War]] fored Thimvertagg to make a huge journey across the frozen sea in order to avoid the armies of [[Fallfaunt]]. Led by [[Yoll-Serok]], a small group survived this massive march and reached the borders of the [[Kultaria|High Kingdom]]. After the end of that epic battle, rumors and songs began to spread throughout the south, of palaces full of gold and temperate lands full of crops, as well as mythical magic and objects with unimaginable uses.

It wasn't long after the ice melted, and the first masts appeared on the southern shores of the High Kingdom. Some to trade, some to explore, some to migrate and some to plunder, gradually more and more tribes traveled north. Some even settled on some coasts, taking land in exchange for guarding it from raiders: These tribes were called Erstali, and to many this is an insult, for they abandoned their traditions and customs and adapted to the laws of Cultaria. As for the rest, some of them travelled to the north-west sea, and colonized various islets. Of these, some made it all the way to the North, while others turned to piracy. Finally, one group wandered even further west, to form colonies in [[Athalahr]].

When the [[Brother's War|civil war of the brothers]] took place, many clans took the opportunity to plunder the shores of High Kingdom. Many times, in fact, they came face to face with their own kin, who were guarding the coasts as mercenaries. These raids lasted several years, until the state of [[Imtaria]] allied with the finfolk and gave their fleet enormous advantages and numbers.

## Legacy

Nowadays the people of Thimvert are the only ones who consistently raid en masse, and Thimvertagg are feared everywhere. The rest of the tribes who view civilized countries as hostile settle for looting and short-range robbery or piracy. However, the situation within the mainland have not given Imtaria, the primary victim of the raids, time to mount a comprehensive full scale attack against them.
