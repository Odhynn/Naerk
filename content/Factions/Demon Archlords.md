## Description

The greatest perils of the Abyss that survived the Demonic Civil War and ruled afterwards. The three archdemons are [[Xeurim]], [[Otynhash]] and [[Disiklek]].

## History

Among the first [[demons]] to entertain the idea of escaping [[Yerastu]]'s service were those who soon found themselves ruling their species. Each in their own insidious way managed to climb the hierarchy and gain power comparable to other gods, extending their influence into the [[Material Plane]]. In their quest to control a horde of demons that is the most unpredictable and dangerous ever, the only option for the Overlords is to fortify their position.

One of the basic principles of the Overlords is that they can even do things that no one would have them capable of. Things that are even outside of their ideology, if it helps to improve their position even a little bit. Those powerful outsiders began projecting their power upon many ambitious, hungry, maddened, or desperate mortals and soon many followed them.
