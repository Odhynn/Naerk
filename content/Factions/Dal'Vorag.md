The first orc of the Broken Skull tribe is said to have been a brave traveler known as [[Grimson]]. He was not afraid of snow and mountains, and he traveled to the farthest parts of the north in search of a better land for his people, until he found one near nowadays [[No'Crel]].

Grimson met his end in a personal quest on [[Legthir Pass] by a troll named [[Balbar]]]. News of Grimson's fate reached the tribe and they thought it was a great disgrace that no one helped him. It was then that they also took the name of the Broken Skull, [[Dal'Vorag]]. They organized a group of warriors to go and bring back his head, but with [[Balgrimm]]'s enhanced forces, the few who arrived unharmed from the cold were slaughtered on the frozen stones of [[Legthir Pass]]. Since then, the Dal'Vorag clan mounted numerous quests over the following decades to retrieve the skull and avenge the troll, but they failed.

Gradually the story became a myth, and the dead warriors there simply the subject of stories around the fire.

In 2427 when the tribe tried to expand to the lowlands of [[Norfol]], several clashes against the [[Baldosh]] broke out. After fierce fighting, the Baldosh managed to stop the Dal'Vorag with the help of the [[Arlas]], but not before they had lost large areas, which the Wise Dragon's tribe never managed to regain.
