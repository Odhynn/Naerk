## Description

An elite order formed to protect those crossing the [[Blackwoods]]. They have complete authority over most of the forest. Most of their forces cross the Vinepass road on a daily basis. There are numerous cases where travellers were saved from the perils of the woods after their intervention.

## Origins

It is believed that originally many of the founding wardens belonged to a group called Leaf Rangers. The order was also formed by other [[Ghost War]] survivors and veterans.
