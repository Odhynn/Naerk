## The Army of the Supreme Tyrant

After the creation of [[Hell]], the first step of the [[devils]] and [[Sergonial]] was to gain followers among mortals. The way to accomplish this was the Scrolls of the Supreme Tyrant. These were ostensibly a gift from him to great tyrants and warlords, enhancing their ability to control their followers, judge and interrogate them, as well as summon help from Hell. No one wondered why he was giving them so generously, and their true power was then shown.

Because, each of these Scrolls could control its user. The result was that the devils soon gained great influence on the [[Material Plane]], as all these armies and countries became their subjects. And all these factions of Sergonial, who always had him first in the hierarchy, and the respective scroll-holder as merely an intermediary, became known as Kenorex. During the following period the devils made deals with many believers, giving them power in exchange for their souls, which would strengthen their armies after death.
