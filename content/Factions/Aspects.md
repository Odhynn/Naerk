The Northerners of [[Korhond]], elves and nomadic orcs, from [[Belgosreim]] to the glacier of [[Hoss]], as well as in northern [[North Darrok|Darrok]] and other tribes, worship primarily the eleven Aspects, that represent the manifestations of the natural world. These are considered most characteristic of life and the world. The Aspects are mighty spirits of the Fifth Dimension, as powerful as gods, who have allied themselves with Malahir and dwell between the [[Evergrowing Forest]], the [[Elemental Ring]] and the [[Material Plane]]. Their worship is linked to primal phenomena and their magic is also connected to nature.

Frequently, Aspects walk into the Material Plane and interfere with important events there in their own, indirect way. They manifest in the form of animals, plants or natural phenomena. Their intervention is multifaceted: From helping warriors in battle, resurrecting the most worthy of them (a typical example is the legendary warlord [[Yoll]]), to fertilizing crops and plants or bringing fair wind to the sails of ships. Their presence is very strong and  interconnected between their domains of influence. As a result, despite ther rivalries, there has been no major conflict between them, but even more so, there are very few cultures that renounce them in the regions they manifest. Mortals who have ben granted the blessing of Aspects bear the Aspect's Mark on their chest.
