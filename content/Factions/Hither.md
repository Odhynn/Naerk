The giants of Hither are spread across all over [[Hlafentar]]. They are what remains in [[Korhond]] of the great empire of [[Gadrunen]]. They live mostly in caves and have devolved, with many cases of cannibalism and cross-breeding with trolls. They are rumored to be very aggressive, with many raids to nearby settlements and roads.
