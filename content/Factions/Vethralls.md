Little is known about the Vethralls, creations of [[Veth]]. Most confuse them with [[Vethians]], and it is often enough for them to say "strange large monsters", a description that satisfies most.

But the truth is quite different. It starts with the Vethralls not following the Vethians when they created the [[Zinctizuctra]], and working with each other more out of necessity. The Vethralls took refuge in [[Tartara]], with painful consequences, and never gained a home of their own, as even there the [[Vulga]] and [[Erevi]] held sway. They had no access to the souls and therefore could never increase their numbers. The Vethralls are doomed to die one by one, though it is almost impossible to do so by natural causes.

That's because the [[Vethralls]] have retained the power they had from ancient times to the fullest: Huge beings, defying every law of nature, with an abundance of supernatural powers. They learned on their own to adapt to their environment better than anyone, and they learned to hide. The world forgot them, and they sank into the deepest parts of Tartara, finding little meaning in the world beyond wreaking havoc on those around them.

Some, however, remained on [[Veth]]. They were able to withstand the harsh conditions of the satellite, and it was time to come back to the spotlight. During the [[Vethfall]], the cosmic energy that fell upon the Na'erk opened a portal that allowed these creatures to pass through the crater and begin their first steps into a new world.

Vethralls are violent, dangerous and unpredictable because most of the world's rules don't apply to them. One cannot say that they are chaotic elements, because they do not know what the law is. No one oppressed their freedom, so they don't get into moral dilemmas: They don't blackmail and they don't take anyone's side. The Vethralls make their own mark on the world, and in their wake it's impossible to predict what will happen. Some see them as embryos, who learn with time: others keep their distance, respecting their immense power. But no one knows what will happen if those in the crater in the [[Mherg Taiga]] come into contact with their brothers from [[Tartara]]. The power of the former combined with the experience of the latter can cause disastrous results and shake the foundations of existence.
