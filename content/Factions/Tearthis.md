Tearthis Pack is arguably one of the most powerful druid circles. This pack was made shortly after the end of the [[Great War of the North]], by 3 mighty druids of the region. [[Biragg]], [[Oliven]] and [[Ingasto]]. Biragg, although the weakest of the three, was the founder and the first leader of the pack.

Biragg operated in [[Zaelvosh Forest]].
Oliven in [[Melario Woods]].
Ingasto in [[Oventhart Dale]].

When the former leader of the [[Erle Pack]], [[Angasar]], came down from the mountains of [[Hoen]] he met Biragg and asked him to join the Tearthis. Biragg first saw a druid stronger than Oliven other than [[Raefibb]] and accepted his proposal. Angasar took action in the forest, [[Volsgon]].

In the year 4531 the [[Beast of Water and Death]] appeared in Oventhart Dale. [[Ingasto]] delayed it as long as she could until the rest of the pack gathered. When this was done the Tearthis managed to seriously injure it and confine it to territory it had already taken, but this was at a high cost. [[Biragg]] fell dead. The Tearthis then made Oliven their leader. Oliven took the option of not going against the monster and simply stopping it until [[Chandor]] came. The other two weren't happy with this choice, but they didn't have a better plan themselves. So, that's how the events unfolded.

When Chandor arrived a legendary battle began, with Tearthis and Chandor being the ones who lived to see the light of day. The devastation in [[Oventhart Dale]] was enormous. It should be expected, considering the Beast was a product of [[Hydarax]] and [[Amehan]] himself. For this reason [[Nahema]] gave her permission to [[Malahir]] to go and fix all that was broken in the Dale. Then she collected all the water of the flooded area in [[Obunk]] and the swamp became a lake. Thus, the Boiling Fountain was created with the excess water. It was a lake with a flame deep within it. _"To mark the [[Fyrlean]]'s victory over Hydarax. To mark your victory over the Beast"_ he told Chandor. _"The new lakes will make [[Oventhart Dale]] more alive than ever. To represent the victory of life over death. For that is the true power of nature"_ he told the Tearthis. _"Thank you everyone, for the battle you fought"_ he told them.

A few years later Oliven recruited [[Estra]], who is now said to be the cursed forest elf, and then recruited [[Anhai]]. Oliven later told the pack that anyone they wanted could take an apprentice and grant them the privilege of joining the pack after the master's death. Anhai died in the year 4799 and was succeeded by his disciple, [[Petton]].

Then, Angasar, who thought Petton was too weak to be a Tearthis, had a skirmish with Oliven. Everyone thought that in this battle Oliven would be the loser. After a few seconds of fighting, Angasar was clearly at a disadvantage and Ingasto was stunned by Oliven's display of power. Then, Angasar, in desperation, shot a bolt of lightning at Oliven and Oliven became one with the sand, momentarily, to avoid the shot. What Oliven didn't count on was a little bird, a few meters behind him, about to be fried by the lightning. Estra and Ingastro, who were stunned by the battle of the mighty druids, did not have time to react. Petton, however, stepped in front of the lightning and saved the bird. Then, Angasar ran to Petton and gave him healing berries. "Anhai would be very proud of you," she told him. "I'm sorry I doubted you," he said to Oliven. "At least our day was interesting, let's do that more often," he replied with a laugh.

Today the pack members are:

Oliven in [[Melario Woods]].
Ingasto in [[Oventhart Dale]], with [[Ranirrah]] as her apprentice.
Angasar in the [[Volsgon]] Forest, with [[Eblion]] as his apprentice.
Estra in [[Cavaroch Forest]].
Petton in the [[Melenhial Forest]], with [[Zetra]] as his apprentice.
