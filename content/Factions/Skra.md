The Skra tribe has an ancient history, since the days of the war against the [[Hither]] giants, the remnants of the [[Gadrunen]] empire. They tried to find their place in the north travelling west of [[Hlafengrond]] and eventually settled in western [[Fervolosh]]. Since then, several rivalries broke the tribe in two and created the [[Lampsir]] tribe to the south.

Skra and Lampsir enmity continued over the years, leading to the events of a [[Wedding Sacriledge]] and a land feud for the south shores of the lake [[Furbung]]. The Steady Hand tribe has sent [[Meegar]] Lurok to the events known as [[Murder Hawk and Linnorm Hunter Saga]].
