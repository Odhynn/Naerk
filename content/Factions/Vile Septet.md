The Seven Archfiends that led the demons through the [[Pyrlon]] portal and took control of the southeast part of the island.

## Beginning of their reign

Many say that [[Olgizmar]]'s decline came from its sorcerers, the [[Demonslavers]]. This, while partially true, is only the beginning. The [[demons]] themselves succeeded more than anyone else in destroying the region, but it was a slow process, like a well-thought-out plan with chess pieces. Demon-summoning mages had developed familiarity with certain powerful demons, whom they began to summon repeatedly for their purposes, as they found it easier to come to terms with them than with begin with someone new.

Among the wizards who befriended certain demons was [[Anthis]] Grindsorrow, the younger brother of the elf [[Queen Taniel]] of the [[Green Hills]]. Anthis had been exiled because the magic he used, the summoning of demons, was forbidden in the Green Hills, and he had found refuge in Olgizmar, then Almahr. Gradually he was able to come into contact with a powerful demon named [[Knaridzna]]: A four-legged huge beast that had thousands of warriors under its command. This of course was something Anthis was unaware of as he was ecstatic at his feat. She continued to call on him more and more often, and he took every opportunity to learn the Pyrlon area and the city's outskirts.

## Summoning Attempt

One day, the [[Demonslaver]] Anthis had arranged a demonstration for other archmages of the [[Demonslavers]] and they had gathered at [[Pyrlon]]'s summoning tower. Properly prepared, Anthis opened a great [[Portal]] to the Abyss, through which Knaridzna passed, who bowed to the haughty mages, who were impressed with the demonic general's power. Their surprise was even greater when another serpentine form emerged from the gate, a powerful demoness brandishing jatagans and shields in her six arms. Then an older mage, [[Lodern]], turned to Anthis and asked if the situation was under control.

## Summoning goes South

The answer came both from Anthis's bewilderment, not expecting another to appear, and from a third, flaming figure appearing at the Gate. The result was beyond Anthis's expectations, precisely because the demons had tricked him and used his own spells to get through the gate and break through the arrogant mage's protections. Lodern was the only mage who managed to teleport away, as he had left his arcane mark for safety reasons: The others watched in awe as Knaridzna slammed his lance down and a field appeared that momentarily broke the concentration of those mages who began chanting spells.

## Chaos in the Portal Site

Chaos ensued. Helpless, the wizards watched the demons tear them apart. Anthis tried to negate and close his Gate but with a Power Word from the flaming demon he was frozen in place watching his colleagues being slaughtered. More demons continued to pass through the gate, and soon the best of Pyrlon's wizards had been slaughtered. Only two remained alive beyond Anthis: An elven sorceress named [[Kervyl]], and an archmage, [[Releston]]. Kervyl, who loathed Anthis had come to the show having cast all the defensive spells she knew, while Releston had transformed into a dragon and began trading blows with the serpentine demoness. Very quickly they surrounded him, as soon as they finished with the rest, but he was able to fly away and save himself.

Kervyl was the last. She shot bolts of lightning from her hands and roasted the first demon that reached her alive, but the rest blocked her every possible way of escape. They began pounding her with claws and swords, but to no avail. After a while she got tired and when [[Knaritzna]] fell on her, he knocked her down and immobilized her. The demons then hung her on the walls and began to torture her. The gate had been left open and there was no one to close it. Soon, hordes of demons had arrived, and they began to spread throughout [[Pyrlon]], which without its strongest mages was a feast for the insatiable jaws of the [[Abyss]].

## Slaughter on the Streets

Within an hour Pyrlon's fate was sealed. The city was filled with demons and its streets were stained with blood. Sorcerers were the first target: Any resident who appeared to cast a spell was instantly targeted by hordes of demons. Initially in some alleys and towers the [[Demonslavers]] tried to put together some defenses, but when huge horned demons broke down the doors and entered, the defense plans fell apart. Soon each mage began to look to their survival and salvage what they could of their belongings. Those who could teleport did so without a second thought: Most of those left behind used illusions to hide and escape, save for a few who decided to fall into battle. Most were selfish enough to not risk their lives for a colleague, and thus the defense soon collapsed.

The streets of the city were painted red as the destruction and carnage exceeded all limits. Each demon that appeared had a different way of satisfying his desires: One slaughtered wizards and impaled them on his spear, another stole babies and burned them, another collected slaves to sell, and another painted poems in her language with the entrails of the dead. Many residents fainted or froze in terror before the inhuman images of horror they saw. The demon army that had been unleashed was accountable to no one and after millennia in the Abyss could do whatever it wanted unhindered. The [[Sages of the North]] refer to it as the most barbaric and brutal act in [[Naerk]] history.

The destruction of the city lasted five days, at the end of which nothing resembled its original form. Half the wizard towers had fallen, many houses were smoking blackened, and the dead had piled up in the squares and alleys, while the wizards had been hung ostentatiously on the highest points of the city, butchered in plain sight. The quarters around the gate had taken on a dark red color, as beyond the demons essence had begun to flow into [[Olgizmar]] from the [[Abyss]] itself. Fiendish veins had hugged the walls like vines and had begun to feed on the corpses of the dead, strengthening the influence of the Abyss.

## Î¤he Spoils of War

The fall of [[Pyrlon]] was not enough for the demons. Even if the first ones were satisfied, the next ones coming out of the Gate were thirsty for blood. They spread to the surrounding areas and soon refugees from all over southern Almahr were trying to escape south. Demons hunted anyone they could find, and soon the [[Demonslavers]] from the rest of the cities had to unite to face the threat. But it was already too late. It was now impossible to close the gate, and even worse they had to release whatever demons they had under their control, as they could not trust summoning magic at all. In the south, there were not a few demons who took advantage of the prevailing chaos to find opportunities to attack their masters.

## Formation

The demon lords who had passed through, however, had greater ambitions than slaughter and plunder. They found that they needed to secure the area they had captured, as well as the gate, while simultaneously wanting to expand. Seven were the leaders gathered to lead the demons: The Vile Septet.

Knaridzna was the first through the Gate and commanded a big part of the vanguard. He had not had enough of the destruction of the city, and he thirsted for new conquests. Then there was [[Mir'girra]], a general who often worked with him and tried to see the big picture beyond the carnage. Third he had followed in pillaging the city was [[Thegmeden]], a small, shadowy, murderous figure believed by many to be the most sadistic of them all.

The next four chieftains came in the following days and weeks and were not involved in the immediate destruction of the city. Their motives were either personal or because one of the trio of Demon Overlords sent him as a servant or spy. They were [[Molroth]], a winged mage, [[Erth'rach]], a lizard-like hunter of Styx, [[Alzagur]], a fiendfolk alchemist, and finally [[Barrelid]], a form between an insect and a dog, who each brought their own subjects and settled in region.

## First Raids and Territory Split

The first raids were easy enough for the demons. They didn't require much coordination on their part: They simply sent armies to pillage, which rarely met resistance in the southern villages of Almahr. In the few cases where they had resistance, they used spells or sent plagues that killed or worse created demonic mutations in the inhabitants. Only in the northern cities was anyone safe. As far as [[Kaylensev]] and [[Vyll River]], the whole area was covered in blood.

This region of the south soon resembled the environment of the [[Abyss]]. The leaves of the trees turned a reddish and brown color, the grass sprouted thorns and the stones turned sharp as razors. Animals became wild and aggressive, while swarms of poisonous insects began to devastate entire plains. Reddish clouds appeared that rained acid rain, or worse sowed the plague of the [[Abyss]] that had no cure, even with magic: [[Abyszmor]]. It is estimated that one in three residents of the area fell victim to it.

The [[Demonslaver]] circles held an emergency meeting, putting aside their personal differences and uniting against the threat. Among them were archmages [[Jalk]] and [[Fromm]] of the Jagsfort circle, [[Jondir]] of the Qwmri, [[Qarsz]] with the vampire patriarch [[Qemberze]] of the Zvennen, and the elven wizard [[Vyldefin]] of the Kmeskyn. After tracing the [[Leylines]] and performing special rituals often sacrificing slaves, they managed to erect powerful magical barriers along the [[Vyll River]] and the [[Mansur]] Mountains, and to a part in the forest of [[Kolnutt]].

These were able to temporarily stop the expansion of the demons, and the [[demons]] then divided the territories among themselves. [[Pyrlon]] became home to [[Molroth]] and [[Mir'girra]], who split it in two. [[Knaridzna]] plundered the eastern plains called [[Abyszbrana]], and [[Barrelid]] went to the southern hills, with the tribes of Xraff, who began to serve her and make sacrifices in her name. [[Erth'rach]] settled in the delta of the rivers, and they were called Krverveka, the black waters. Alzagur went to the forest of [[Kolnutt]] to experiment and mutate with animals and plants and lastly [[Thegmeden]] took the eastern shores next to the forests, which became known as the [[Frostrifts]], vast expanses of unnatural red ice and undead that seemed to have emerged from [[Styx]]. Within weeks half of [[Olgizmar]] was unrecognizable.

## [[Bloodline War]]

The conquest of the [[demons]] was eventually stopped by the defensive barriers that the Demonslavers built. Fortunately for them, there was another way out. A thin strip of land connected [[Olgizmar]] to [[Darrok]], a flat tidal expanse that at low tide barely became land and could be walked on for a few hours. It also had many dangerous reefs, which made most ships except small boats avoid this passage at high tide. This passage became the focus of the [[Vile Septet]] and the subsequent [[Bloodline War]]. The primary focus was the fortified city of [[Lamerpad]], a prize that was critical to gain a foothold in the mainland of [[South Darrok]]. The defence, however, was tested and proved true.
