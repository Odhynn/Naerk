The Seven Archfiends that led the demons through the [[Pyrlon]] portal and took control of the southeast part of the island.

## Beginning of their reign

Many say that [[Olgizmar]]'s decline came from its sorcerers, the [[Demonslavers]]. This, while partially true, is only the beginning. The [[demons]] themselves succeeded more than anyone else in destroying the region, but it was a slow process, like a well-thought-out plan with chess pieces. Demon-summoning mages had developed familiarity with certain powerful demons, whom they began to summon repeatedly for their purposes, as they found it easier to come to terms with them than with begin with someone new.

Among the wizards who befriended certain demons was [[Anthis]] Grindsorrow, the younger brother of the elf [[Queen Taniel]] of the [[Green Hills]]. Anthis had been exiled because the magic he used, the summoning of demons, was forbidden in the Green Hills, and he had found refuge in Olgizmar, then Almahr. Gradually he was able to come into contact with a powerful demon named [[Knaridzna]]: A four-legged huge beast that had thousands of warriors under its command. This of course was something Anthis was unaware of as he was ecstatic at his feat. She continued to call on him more and more often, and he took every opportunity to learn the Pyrlon area and the city's outskirts.

One day, Anthis had arranged a demonstration for other archmages of the [[Demonslavers]] and they had gathered at [[Pyrlon]]'s summoning tower. Properly prepared, Anthis opened a great [[Portal]] to the Abyss, through which Knaridzna passed, who bowed to the haughty mages, who were impressed with the demonic general's power. Their surprise was even greater when another serpentine form emerged from the gate, a powerful demoness brandishing jatagans and shields in her six arms. Then an older mage, [[Lodern]], turned to Anthis and asked if the situation was under control.

The answer came both from Anthis's bewilderment, not expecting another to appear, and from a third, flaming figure appearing at the Gate. The result was beyond Anthis's expectations, precisely because the demons had tricked him and used his own spells to get through the gate and break through the arrogant mage's protections. Lodern was the only mage who managed to teleport away, as he had left his arcane mark for safety reasons: The others watched in awe as Knaridzna slammed his lance down and a field appeared that momentarily broke the concentration of those mages who began chanting spells.

Chaos ensued. Helpless, the wizards watched the demons tear them apart. Anthis tried to negate and close his Gate but with a Power Word from the flaming demon he was frozen in place watching his colleagues being slaughtered. More demons continued to pass through the gate, and soon the best of Pyrlon's wizards had been slaughtered. Only two remained alive beyond Anthis: An elven sorceress named [[Kervyl]], and an archmage, [[Releston]]. Kervyl, who loathed Anthis had come to the show having cast all the defensive spells she knew, while Releston had transformed into a dragon and began trading blows with the serpentine demoness. Very quickly they surrounded him, as soon as they finished with the rest, but he was able to fly away and save himself.

Kervyl was the last. She shot bolts of lightning from her hands and roasted the first demon that reached her alive, but the rest blocked her every possible way of escape. They began pounding her with claws and swords, but to no avail. After a while she got tired and when [[Knaritzna]] fell on her, he knocked her down and immobilized her. The demons then hung her on the walls and began to torture her. The gate had been left open and there was no one to close it. Soon, hordes of demons had arrived, and they began to spread throughout [[Pyrlon]], which without its strongest mages was a feast for the insatiable jaws of the [[Abyss]].
