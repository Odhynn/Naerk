## Description

A vast empire that extended over the whole of the present plain of [[Marelthia]] as well as all the southern half of [[Allwick]].

## Origin

Zulhan's prime was difficult. Dragons sowed terror in towns and villages, while battles between mighty beings were a frequent occurrence at the ancient times. In order to survive, the people of the empire built vast underground cities in the [[Deeps]], stretching hundreds of miles underground, away from the dangers of the surface.

## Firefolk

In the underground foundations of their civilisation, they found a new race already living there: the Firefolk. The first contact of the two peoples was peaceful. Both sides agreed that they could coexist with mutual understanding. Soon, relations between the two peoples improved. Trade flourished, and soon they appointed a supreme council that made decisions with the mutual participation of the most powerful families. They built unique architectural monuments above and below ground: From temples and academies to towers and huge palaces.
