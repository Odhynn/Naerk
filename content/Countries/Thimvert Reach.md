## History

Barbarians nowadays inhabit and travel to many parts of [[Jalarak Ocean]]. But most of them, from to the northerners of [[Korhond]] and the isolated tribes of the south, trace their roots back to Thimvert, the island pirates and raiders. The history of Thimvert dates back to almost the year 2500, when the nomadic tribes of the south, who lived in igloos and on ice, built ships that could cover long distances and carry several dozen warriors. Then, the barbarians of Thimvert began to trade and plunder other areas and this allowed them to grow and settle permanently in the port now known as [[Tublirk]]. The sturdy folk of Thimvert organised as [[Thimvertagg]] tribe. They survived [[Winter's War]] and continued raiding to this day.
