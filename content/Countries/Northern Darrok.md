## History

The country was the part of [[Darrok]] that was north of the [[Tarhelm]] mountain range. This created a physical barrier to communication between north and south, and as a result the cultures that developed in these two regions were completely different. North consisted of barren lands, three fortress cities, mountaineers, orcs, dwarves and some barbarian tribes. Most of all, the inhabitants valued their independence, and were among the first to understand the corruption and exploitation in the vast empire of Imtaria and its allied states of [[Palaurim]].

When they sought their independence from [[Palaurim]], a full-scale civil war broke out. Those who condemned this alliance after a defeat sought refuge in the foothills of Tarhelm. It went through a very difficult period. A series of unexplained violent storms hit the region hard. Food was scarce, while simultaneously they wanted to help the wave of refugees from the south. At the same time, a decade of embargo was already taking place, the Palaurim fleet restricting trade and routes of ships in the bays of [[Mheir]] and [[Skator]]. This made the situation even worse, for in northern Darrok they had a lot of commercial exports in metals, salt, weapons and precious stones. However, they were slowly able to find a balance and meet their needs by organizing an oligarchic form of government with a council that included representatives from the dwarves, settled refugees, mountaineers, and fort generals. Even then, because of the orcs and barbarian raids, peace is an unknown word in Tarhelm but the situation has improved thereafter.

## Culture

The original Darrok manners, customs and dialect have been conserved much more in the north compared to the south.
