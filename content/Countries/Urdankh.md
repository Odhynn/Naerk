## Jewel of the Sea

Following the end of the [[Brother's War]], which stained [[Kultaria]] with blood, the Water Element-born successors retreated northwest to the Urdankh Peninsula. Their survival was difficult at first, as peace in the wider region was a thing of the past. To the north and west the Bugbears had begun their raids from the swamps, while the lizardfolk on the peninsula who traditionally resided there took quite a hostile view of the new invaders.

However, the finfolk were particularly determined to settle there. They had superior weapons and were supported by very powerful priests. They chose to fight their battles in deep water, which made the movements of their opponents more difficult. However, they were outnumbered, so they were forced to retreat north. They managed to get through the Bugbear territories, but the lizardmen knew their territory well and could constantly harass them with ambushes and traps.

Winter found the finfolk hungry and exhausted. But they had reached the northern shores of Urdankh. An area where the sea is particularly shallow and calm, and has vast expanses of coral, some of which are said to have a will and thought of their own. In this place they were able to settle permanently, as they were able to quickly find harmony with the place, while the lizardmen no longer had a reason to chase them so far from the swamps in the dead of winter.

From that time, in the year 3339, the finfolk were able to recover rapidly. They built vast castles and palaces above and below the sea, centered on [[Helezaar]]. The next step was to make a temporary truce with the lizardmen, with their relations gradually improving. After three years of coexistence, the last step was to declare Urdankh as an independent country, with the main population portions being finfolk, lizardfolk, and various hill-dwellers. The establishment of [[Imtaria]], a little later, revealed to the developing country a potential ally. Trade between the two countries flourished, with Urdankh importing alchemical wares, weapons, and timber, and exporting ships, skilled sailors, fisheries, as well as its famed coral wood. The Urdankh then became a key part of the navy of the entire Palaurim.

Urdankh currently has 3 councelors in [[Palaurim]] and is ruled by [[Queen Ilaera]] Nalaryan.
