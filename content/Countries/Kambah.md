## History

Kambah was a western district of Oventhart. It exported metals, minerals, quality timber and furs and had good trade relations with the surrounding regions, even with Imtaria Kambah was regarded as one of the most violent and dangerous lands in all of [[Naerk]]. Many races of orcs, nomadic or not, inhabited the area and the battles between them were bloody. Amidst these conflicts the [[Kenorex]], Sergonial's diabolical army, began to mass in the fortress of [[Aar]] in the year 4703. The orc [[Fasroh]], the first Tyrant, set out on a campaign to subdue the orcs, and soon battles broke out across the land. He was a former general of [[Oventhart]] that deserted and demanded independence under his iron fist. Eventually, war broke out between Kambah and [[Imtaria]] as Oventhart called for help and the southeners took the opportunity to gain influence. [[Emperor Ilarein]] sent an army to stop Kambah from attacking Oventhart and several major battles were fought that started the two countries' rivalry.

Numerous insurrections were incited by elves and [[Berenfaer]] from the eastern provinces to the borders with [[Oventhart]] during the late years of Fasroh's reign. Seeing his inability to take action, his grandchild [[Karahath]] killed him and ascended to his place. As a new tyrrant, he reformed and united [[Kenorex]] and orcs and he waged a sudden campaign that stopped the insurgents. He rallied giants and goblins from mountainous [[Hoen]] and marched south with a [[Defeated Army|huge and overwhelming army]]. After the defeat at [[Battle of Fherlon Plains]], he retreated back with his remaining Kenorex forces and [[Kambah]]'s hopes for territorial expansion came to a halt.

Several decades afterwards, [[Karahath]] had recoverd from this failure. The armies of [[Kambah]] [[War of Karahath|attacked]] [[Oventhart]] and they annexed the town of [[Whitecross]] and several regions of southwestern [[Oventhart]] after many battles.
