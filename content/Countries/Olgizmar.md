Four centuries ago, the region east of Darrok was called Almahr and was one of the wealthiest regions in the Inner Sea. Its success was partly due to its geographical position, which made it a trading center between [[Korhond]], Northern [[Darrok]] and [[Imtaria]]. Unfortunately, on this region was a guild of powerful wizards, also known as [[Demonslavers]], who had absolute control over power and the distribution of goods.

Demonslavers derived much of their power from serving demons. With time-consuming and demanding sacrifices and ceremonies, they could summon demons who obeyed them to the letter. Often, of course, the price was enormous: Hundreds of human souls were sacrificed, while rarely did a mage escape the Abyss upon death. All too soon, arrogance overwhelmed the mages of Almahr. They believed themselves to be superior to other mortals and it was hard to deny that when even the most insignificant wizard in the land had at least one demon in his service. From a moment on, most of the army was made up of demons.

Almahr quickly expanded westward. But Darrok saw the threat and responded in time. Many of his brave warriors were sacrificed in the first battles, so that the dwarves could build fortresses in several places that would limit the expansion of demons and wizards, among them Khalaram and Keyrod. At the same time, sensing the threat, Imtaria sent a fleet to limit Almahr's naval power to the south. At last, with many casualties, after two years of warfare, the wizards halted their advance and changed their plan.

After a lengthy council, they decided to turn to their greatest power, magic. They began to sacrifice anyone who was expendable to them to get revenge, and soon the demon army doubled in size. What they didn't know, however, was that the demons were dangerous to them as well. Thus they answered the call without recompense from moment to moment, and passed en masse through the Gates into the material dimension. One day in 4529, the demons broke the seals that kept them enslaved by the wizards and attacked their masters, in a month-long bloodbath. Almahr was then renamed Olgizmar, the black wasteland. Mysteriously, a piece of Olgizmar after this sacrifice flooded and Olgizmar became an island now, as the thin strip of land connecting it to Darrok was lost.

The wizards, however, were strong enough to hold in some areas, such as the capital city of Dorvolosh. Also, once the seals were broken, many demons found that they could not stay in the material dimension for long. At the same time, however, some Gates remained open, and operated in a limited manner. So today there is a very strange situation in the area, where magicians and demons coexist, and in each area some are masters and some are slaves.

The southern part of the island, centered on Pyrlon, has been dominated by demons, and rumor has it that they have at least one gateway to and from the Abyss. The woods are dark and mysterious to the southeast, as the influence of demons is strong, and the place resembles an Abyss. Accordingly, in the northwest mages have been able to limit the expansion of the demons, and have filled the area near Dorvolosh with protective runes and spells that keep the demons at bay. At the same time, in Gatewatch there is a lair of wizards, who try to keep the demons at bay, but they receive many raids. It is where the island's largest gate is located, and it is vital to the Demonslavers that the demons do not take it under their control. The tide always tilts one way or the other, but the ambivalent effect of constant conflict limits one side from taking absolute control.
