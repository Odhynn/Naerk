A great glacier north of [[Hoen]] and [[Korhond]]. It is unnatural cold and home only to the most daring travellers. Frost giants and snow goblins roam these lands, as well as wendigo undead that [[Totem War|appeared]] during [[Winter's War]]. Numerous ley lines cross the glacier and converge at the ice palace of [[Fol'rish]]: full of fey and elementals, stands out as a unique magical wonder that holds great power over the frozen wastes. The icy winds that blow travel from the vast depths of the North. Very few have mapped this area, and even fewer have traveled north of the [[Foljatar]] range. Thus, it can hardly be said how the huge glacier of Hoss, which descends to the border of [[Korhond]] and [[Hoen]] and has enormous effects in all areas, has been created.

Before the Winter's War, however, the glacier barely reached as far as [[Ofsån]]. The climate in the surrounding area was much warmer, and to the east of [[Åperbung]] there was a relatively fertile, by northern standards, valley between the mountain ranges. However, as the temperature began to drop, large masses of water solidified on the northern side of [[Foljatar]], and slowly began to expand southward. The area had a lot of water, so when it started to freeze, the area it covered swelled quickly. Many residents abandoned their settlements and fled southwest and southeast. Even in the south, the icy winds quickly made living along the frozen [[Folumb]] River a daily struggle for survival, while by the end of the Winter's War the glaciers had almost reached the [[Volosherg]] Forest.

But this sudden expansion did not happen by itself. The Avatar of [[Fallfaunt]], the ice goddess, had played a crucial role. Four powerful creatures, also known as Wendigo, had appeared in the area. Their leader, named [[Kairaslu]], was among the oldest and hungriest of his kind. It is unknown if these were the fault of the glacier or if the glacier drew them there. In any case, however, the creatures began killing entire villages. Their speed was unimaginable and their hunger insatiable. Within weeks thousands of natives had been slaughtered, and the monsters, as servants of the ice goddess, offered up all the souls they killed and ate to increase the Fallhaunt's influence in the material dimension, more simply to expand the ice, snow and to drop the temperature. The four leaders soon ended up having hundreds of undead at their command, created from the corpses of their victims.

The northerners were not left idly by. They organized a unit of their toughest warriors. Among them were some whose names are still spoken with awe in the stories around the fire: Galver, the Bear's son, Finla the huntress, Car'voth the greytooth, and many others. After killing the undead the leaders had created, they sought them out. The chase that followed seemed endless. Even the Huntsman offered indirect help, but always these creatures survived and struck again. Clashes continued for many weeks, in a life and death struggle. In the end, Yøll Serok, the barbarian from Thimvert, also came, and with his help they lit a huge fire with wood from the Evergrowing Forest and made a circle where the creatures waited. The battle that followed is still sung in the North in many sagas. Eventually the warriors slaughtered the creatures, one after the other, and burned their carcasses. To ensure that the glacier would not expand, they palled their burnt corpses and performed a ceremony invoking deeds along the glacier's edge.

With the end of the Winter's War, glaciers began to gorge, rift and melt in the south, causing Åperbung to double in size and fill the area with hidden gorges, streams and rivers. The glacier remains within the confines of the four battered Wendigos, whose corpses are still preserved and protected by powerful runes. Many locals believe that their existence is bad luck, and they can come to life at any time. Others think they would do well to stay where they are, and discourage the younger ones from venturing to touch the mighty relics.
