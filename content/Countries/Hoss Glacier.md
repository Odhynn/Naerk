A great glacier north of [[Hoen]] and [[Korhond]]. It is unnatural cold and home only to the most daring travelers. Frost giants and snow goblins roam these lands, as well as wendigo undead that [[Totem War|appeared]] during [[Winter's War]]. Numerous ley lines cross the glacier and converge at the ice palace of [[Fol'rish]]: full of fey and elementals, stands out as a unique magical wonder that holds great power over the frozen wastes.
