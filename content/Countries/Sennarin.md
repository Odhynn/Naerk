- nation of human and elven refugees fleeing from a cataclysmic event in their homeworld of the Realms Beyond

## History

### the Arrival
In 4790, the Sennarii appeared en masse through the ancient elven portal of Edhailin, pouring out of the Lake of the Moon by the thousands and breaking the portal in the process

### the Arrival Wars

A series of clashes lasting 14 years between the Sennarii and the Bjåglanders, who had just began colonizing the region before the Arrival and would not easily cede it to the newcomers.

### the Sennarii Expeditions to Selanaar

Joint ventures led by the Clans of Snow to explore the peninsula of old Selanahr during the Blood Moon months. Two expeditions were undertaken, the first during Leafdrop of 4796, the second during Leafdrop of 4816; both ended in unspeakable carnage and disaster. 

## Geography

### Major settlements
- Shiliage, regional capital of the Clans of Thunder
- Toriizo, regional capital of the Clans of Rain
- Fuyusei, regional capital of the Clans of Snow
- Rhan, regional capital of the Clans of Mist
- Yoakyuuden, where the clan delegations assemble

## Politics

The forest of Mitheryn is home to the druidic [[Circle of the Stag]].

### Diplomatic relations
- budding trade frameworks with [[Alagon]] and [[Stormfall]]
- joint scholarly projects with [[Kwarix]]
- informal alliances and trade with the [[Athar]] Confederation
- improving yet still cool relations with [[Bjåglant]], following the peace treaty that ended the Arrival Wars in 4804

### The Lords' Assembly

The council that determines common strategy for the Sennarii clans comprises of the following clan lords and ladies (note that in Sennarii tradition, clan names come first):
- Are Shinzou, Clans of Thunder
- Hida Ishigaki, Clans of Thunder[^1]
- Sanjuro Dai, Clans of Thunder
- Hanazawa Hoshiko, Clans of Rain
- Samenagare Kentaro, Clans of Rain
- Kashiwa Hime, Clans of Snow 
- Kashiwa Sen, Clans of Snow
- Hwinnderi Eryn, Clans of Mist

[^1]: currently in exile, but still a member of the council officially
