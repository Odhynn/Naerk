- nation of human and elven refugees fleeing from a cataclysmic event in their homeworld of the Realms Beyond

## History

### the Arrival
In 4790, the Sennarii appeared en masse through the ancient elven portal of Edhailin, pouring out of the Lake of the Moon by the thousands and breaking the portal in the process

### the Arrival Wars

A series of clashes lasting 14 years between the Sennarii and the Bjåglanders, who had just began colonizing the region before the Arrival and would not easily cede it to the newcomers.

Ατ the spring of the year 4798, Bjåglant's raiders made their third large-scale raid on Sennarin in 8 years. Τhe first to be called upon to face them were the same ones who had fought them in the previous two raids: The Clans of Thunder. There were two main clans that had the largest part of the military power: the Are in the north and the Hida in the south. Originally, the Are had a much larger army, prestige and power, but they suffered from one basic problem: Lack of enough arable land. In many villages the villagers were starving.

Are clan chose to deal with the Oni devils first, in an attempt to expand their lands northward. Most people disagreed with this move, as initially the threat of Bjåglant's barbarians was much more immediate, and most would rather face twenty humans, orcs or dwarves than one Oni. The battles with the Oni were over by the year 4793, but the cost was too heavy. The land they had won was disproportionately small compared to the cost in warrior lives. Among the people, a rumor began to circulate that the lord [[Are Shinzou]] was executing everyone who retreated from the battle with the Oni. Even worse, word got out that their main way of dealing with the problem of starvation was by sending the world to certain death and thereby reducing the number of mouths asking for food.

On the other hand, Lord Ishigaki of the Hida clan focused on meeting the needs of the people in the south. He strengthened trade and agriculture in order to be able to cover all the nutritional needs of the inhabitants. Soon, however, he was called upon to face Bjåglant's raiders alone: ​​Lord Shinzou refused his plea for help, saying that he too had not helped him in the battles against the Oni to the north. Hida then realized that things were difficult. His warriors numbered barely eight thousand, while his scouts on land and sea estimated Thimvert's forces at many times that number.

The first two invasions were met with ambushes on rocks and reefs, as well as the aid of powerful wizards who could control the weather: one of them was Kworion, a renegade Cornuzel archmage who had sought refuge in the west. But the third raid, in the spring of 4798, was different. The Bjåglanders now knew what they were up against, and organized a superior plan. They sent twice as many ships as ever, nearly two hundred, which anchored in the river Draugrelfr without much loss from the skirmishes, but even this strong coastal force was only a distraction. The main body of their army had followed another, slower route, from the borders of the Harrowlands inland. This route was especially dangerous because of ghosts and Oni, but they had shamans who had communicated with spirits who would protect them for the days of their journey.

They attacked the northern border of the Clans of Thunder, in the south of Lord Shinzou, and began to plunder cities and villages. The resistance they met was meager, as the main body of his army was in the north, on yet another desperate campaign against the Oni. The two groups of barbarians joined at the headwaters of the Draugrelfr River, and violently attacked Shinzou's army, who had managed to line up his army and recall about twelve thousand fighting men. But the barbarians numbered twenty thousand, and although the Are had the advantage of the ground, they were quite unprepared for the sudden charge that followed. The battle lasted many hours, with its result being inconclusive.

All this time, Ishigaki did not stand idly by. He gathered his army and burned the ships of the Bjåglanders, after slaughtering the meager defenses they had left behind. By the time he got to the battle, the tide had begun to tilt slightly in favor of the barbarians, but Lord Shinzou considered retreat cowardice and dishonor, so his warriors fought to the death. The Hida attacked the barbarians in the rear, and then, with renewed morale, the Are held their ground till the two bodies of the army joined: and by evening, nearly half the barbarians lay on the ground, dead or wounded: They retreated disorderly, and very few managed, in the end, to return to their country. Since then, everyone avoids the river, which is often littered with skeletons and ghosts of barbarian warriors, even Ghost Ships, justifying the name Ghost River.

But Lord Hida had also suffered huge losses: Half of his warriors were dead or wounded. He did not hesitate to accuse Lord Ishigaki on the spot: That he had let the barbarians attack him without stopping them, and that his higher aim was to stage a coup d'état to take power into his own hands, now that he now possessed the largest army among to the Clans of Thunder: and gave him three days' respite to give up Shiliage, his seat in the port, and go into exile from Sennarin.

Then many of the Hida clan suggested that Ishigaki strike first: Gather his now larger army and make a surprise attack at night. But Hida, loyal to the law, refused. He gathered his faction and prepared five ships to leave, with the Samurai loyalists. But the next morning he saw that he was followed by many more than he had expected: forty-two other ships, full of his loyal soldiers, who had fought with him in many battles and refused to desert him. So ex-Lord [[Hida]] first set sail for [[Stormsfall]], and most of the exiles stayed with him.

### the Sennarii Expeditions to Selanaar

Joint ventures led by the Clans of Snow to explore the peninsula of old Selanahr during the Blood Moon months. Two expeditions were undertaken, the first during Leafdrop of 4796, the second during Leafdrop of 4816; both ended in unspeakable carnage and disaster.
