Allwick is arguably the largest desert in [[Naerk]]. Many geological and supernatural factors influenced its creation, but the main one was the devastation from [[Il'vec]], whose swarm destroyed everything in its path down from the root. Rainfall is extremely rare in the region, the winds are strong, and water equally hard to find. Accordingly, there are very few creatures and settlements within it, as survival in these adverse conditions is a daily challenge.

The largest part of the population is made up of nomads, who travel seasonally to the best areas for survival. Most are humans, gnolls, windfolk and firefolk. These four tribes have frequent animosities with each other, but there are several nomadic tribes in which humans coexist with windfolk or firefolk. The only exceptions are Allwick's two largest cities: [[Amaross]] and [[Xe'Farom]], which have a wide racial and cultural range.

The reaches north and west of Allwick are inhabited by the most friendly and understanding. Several tribes near the [[Blackwoods]] and [[Windhill]] are friendly and hospitable to travelers, most notably the [[Pearlsnake]] and [[Kalgrix]]. These places are also home to most of the caravans, which head into the Blackwoods to reach Oventhart, or even descend as far as [[Tithlon]] in many cases, carrying desert gems, magical goods and unique rocks and economically linking the north with the south. Of particular interest are the windfolk in [[Windhill]], an area of ​​perpetual sandstorms, chosen by several of their shamans to communicate with the Elemental Ring and with ancient spirits to learn events of the past.

To the south, as far as the plains of [[Marelthia]], the only survivors are the gnolls and a few firefolk. Gnolls in particular are often organized into huge warbands and pose a great danger to nearby areas and unsuspecting travelers. Insects are also frequent in this area, either in swarms that devour everything in their path, descendants of [[Il'vec]], or huge beetles and scorpions that run and dig as fast as horses and often exceed ten feet in length, while there are reports of ten times the size.

In the east, things are even more savage. To the north, the goblins thresh a large area, centered on [[Tertels]], their semi-subterranean city. Just before the sea is [[Caulnorr]], which is the largest surviving Cyclops civilization from ancient times. The dimensions of their city walls are enormous, and the place is both impregnable and a natural desert frontier. To protect themselves from the attacks of the tens of thousands of hobgoblins from the north, the cyclops have built a massive wall along their territory. Most have now accepted that it's best to just avoid the place.

In the southeast, the various tribes live together, but by no means peacefully. From Galandu to the [[Veth Spikes]], the place is filled with bandits and criminals, and the seas are plagued by piracy. The only factor that can be imposed is the wizards based in Xe'Farom, who in fact often travel the wider area, as in addition to the magical crystals of the Veth Spikes it has all sorts of scattered ancient relics and magical objects that are sources of power and wisdom. In these parts, it is not uncommon in a caravan to find people from ten different tribes, often each traveling for completely different reasons.
