The history of  Korhond is lost in the centuries before the first cities and the development of trade. Its roots go back to the first humans, six and a half millennia ago. In ancient times, the North was an assembly place for many tribes, who fought for territorial claims and access to hunting and later, for reasons of honor, vendetta and revenge. When orcs came from the east and began to expand into the area, the conflicts became even more fierce. The orcs and humans that survived were either the strongest and most resistant to hardships, either those that hid in mountains, caves and glaciers, or those that were able to form alliances and call upon them in times of invasion or war.

The first tribes settled after many hardships in the foothills of Hlafentar, as well as in the forests of present-day Fervolosh. The ancient North had infinite dangers. On one hand the goblins and hobgoblins, who were already in Hlafentar and the forest and were constantly raiding the rest, with no inclination to share their territories with others. On the other hand, numerous wild beasts, which still sow terror in the North. The danger of both predators and many herbivores left no place in the Korhond where one could feel safe. The groups that hunted some of them out of necessity were made up of people who did not always belong to the same tribe, so they formed strong friendship bonds. And finally, there were Giants from the Empire of [[Godrunen]], who had settlements and fortresses on the mountains and could scatter in their wake entire armies of the bravest warriors.

Their very enemies indicated to the Northerners with whom they could ally themselves. The common dangers they faced forced them to create relationships of recognition and trust between them, often out of necessity, a necessity that eventually became a habit. However, before a more permanent solution could be established, a catalytic intervention was needed that could significantly reduce the merciless skirmishes and battles that had stained the northern snow red.

And this factor was none other than the Aspects. Creatures of nature, the strongest servants of Malahir, the Aspects may have had many disagreements with each other, but they all had as their ultimate goal the establishment of harmony in the natural world and those who respected it. The Aspects were particularly impressed by the bravery, endurance and morale of the Northerners, so they focused heavily their efforts in order to bring stability. At the same time, this was made possible by the contribution of several shamans, druids and nature priests, who had power in each faction and could very easily get along with others, even if they were servants of other Aspects. In the North, although there could be no total agreement, there could be respect.

The situation that forced the Northerners to unite happened when a great epidemic fell in the region. Also known as Feralga, the Wail, this disease contaminated the water and anyone who drank it had a serious chance of getting sick. The symptoms were constant stomach pains and vomiting, while the victim's blood turned black and poisoned. This epidemic caused all the healers and magic users to travel back and forth from tribe to tribe, thus strengthening their cooperation.

In later years, as many tribes were weakened, goblin incursions into the east became a very common occurrence. However, the Northmen, after some defeats, began to work together, many tribes together, so as to limit the power of the goblins. Three years later, the goblins were confined to Jargad's cape, while the allies built the Stone House. It was the first stone dwelling in the north, after the giants' wonders, and marked a period in which the daily slaughter had ceased, while at the same time the settlement of many tribes in permanent dwellings had been finalized.

When the most serious challenges of the Wail and the goblins were over, the Northmen emerged stronger than ever. This, combined with the recent alliances, led to the creation and establishment of the [[VÃ¸lrad]], the battle through which territorial and other disputes in Fervolosh are settled. [[Torniv]], the Stone House remains to this day the most important cultural place of Korhond and marks its unification in dire times, as well as its glorious history.

Hardships, adversities and skirmishes in the North with all sorts of two-legged or four-legged adversaries are daily, and only those accustomed to such a life can stay there for long.
