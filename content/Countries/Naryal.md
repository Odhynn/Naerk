## History

Naryal was first established in [[Edhelwood]] as a nation during the [[Edhellin]], the very first elves, and was known by that name. For fourteen centuries the elves flourished and lived in peace, creating one of the most powerful magical civilizations in [[Naerk]]. 

The defeat of the elves and the massive destruction of the capital of Naryal in the year -1320, was overwhelming. Many say that a lesson was then taught to the elves for their arrogance and reckless use of their power and the [[Vaelasil|Orb of Darkness]], and all were sure that the elves would never be able to get back on their feet. They were broken and scattered in the wind. Some went exiles in distant lands, others had migrated because of the war to [[Tithlon]] and [[River Ilmen]] in the south, while a few remaining were defeated in [[Edhelwood]], under the remains of their ravaged homes and burnt trees.

A large part of the army of humans and mostly orcs that had invaded stayed in the forest, making sure the elves wouldn't do anything stupid again, but that was probably just a pretext. The orcs made the forest their permanent home, because they quickly realized that it was much better than their own lands, much more fertile, with water, hunting and protection. And at the same time, they enslaved the elves and forced them to serve them. And the foes who therefore settled permanently there, very quickly became hated among the elves.

The longevity of the elves made them never forget their defeat and the oppression of their people. The hatred they harbored for the orcs multiplied in those years, and it was able to rally elves from the far reaches of Naerk. From the far reaches of the north to [[Imtaria]] and [[Oventhart]], the elves rallied under the banner of a proud but humble hero named [[Alazir]] Silverflame. Alazir was among the oldest surviving elves, and many believed him to be [[Talyrian]]'s grandson, though he himself remained silent on his parentage. He was stubborn and unyielding in his determination, and was able to unwittingly gather fifty thousand elves under his command, ready to attack.

[[Edhelwood Reclaiming|The attack]] took place early in the spring of the year -1139. The orcs were caught off guard: Young, inexperienced warriors, facing elves who had been preparing their revenge and sharpening their swords for two centuries. The attack swept the orcs like a storm across the plain, and it is said that from this attack only four orcs survived, leaving them to carry the news to the four points of the horizon. The sudden re-domestication of [[Edhelwood]] this time outwards seemed like a catharsis at the end of a drama and no one wanted to interfere, while many were in awe of this display of power. Sure, the orcish cruelty towards the elves had been known to the outside world.

And so Naryal rose again from its ashes, and the elves rebuilt their cities: [[Ryador]], [[Ilidran]], [[Harial]], and several smaller ones. The gods themselves blessed the place, as [[Volrek]] gave Alazir a seed to plant in the forest. This seed grew into a beautiful Willow, also known as [[Ilmariel]], and the elves kept its location a secret. It is said that with this tree as their focus, the elves were able to reconnect with the magic of their ancestors and strengthen the protection of the forest. Many druids appeared in the forest, even some creatures from the Evergrowing Forest.

The culmination of Edhelwood's unique beauty came many years later. The first place the creatures of the Evergrowing Forest came to after the Ghost War, when they had run out of Blackwoods, was there. And just like that, the forest was filled with life, song and all manner of mysterious creatures, from satyrs to centaurs and fairies. And it is said that it was this connection to the natural world that was able to keep the elves to this day indestructible, rather than access to their ancient magic alone. Why, the elves may no longer live forever, fly in the clouds and stop time, but many believe that now that the elves have realized their weakness and live with the creatures of nature, that they are stronger as people ever since.
