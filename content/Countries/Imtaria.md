## History

 Imtaria was formed after the tragic events of the [[Brother's War]] in [[Kultaria]]'s original territory at year 3325. The first empress, [[Empress Zuria|Zuria]] "the Truth" Kaldun, was the only surviving offspring of the original Sajanu bloodline. After many years of civil war and a huge portion of the country's infrastructure destroyed, she planned a decade of rebuilding and another decade of expanding to the former borders, restoring lords and settling territorial disputes. She also revived the mutual trust and economic relationships with the water creatures on the [[Urdankh]] Peninsula. Then, at year 3345, Imtaria was officialy named an empire.

 Century by century, the power of the former kingdom was partially restored. Soon Imtaria became one of the most populous and wealthy regions. At year 3950, with the initiative of [[Emperor Ralos III]], a treaty named [[Palaurim]] was formed to increase the country's influence and wealth while acting as a strategic defender for all the other contributing countries. Imtaria has 28 councelors in Palaurim.
