 Yushan, now officially a god, created a demiplane for his student, [[Hansa]]: the Infinite Library. This demiplane is mutually connected to Zinctizuctra and [[Utopia]], as the quest for knowledge reaches all monasteries and holy places. It contains a library of every kind of knowledge of Hansa and his followers, and has properties that bend the very essence of space, making it endless. Hansa spends most of his time here, either writing books himself or arranging them.
