## Creation

Shortly before [[Veth]]'s final defeat, many of his subjects realized that the battle was lost. They thus made many plans of what they can do to survive, and concluded that they must create a shelter, a place accessible only to them, in which they could live safely. While everyone else was busy fighting, they prepared to make the great escape.

[[Maeronian]] and [[Lebdegah]], the leaders of these, known as the Vethians, after many disputes with the [[Vethralls]], found a way. They contacted the [[Primordials]] [[Yushan]] and [[Rhekvethor]], who also wanted a place to stay for their own reasons, and formed a ceremony. They faced each other and screamed with all their might, and those present saw that when the two shock waves collided, a plane was created that began to rupture constantly. When all present on the ritual joined their cries of challenge to the sound, the voice was heard by both the Primordials and in Na'erk, but by the time they reached the spot, ready to annihilate them, they were already gone, and the only what was left behind were inarticulate screams that quickly died away. This is how the scream fields were created, or at least their original form.

## Resolution

Because of the unorthodox way it was created, and its name, this place quickly acquired, perhaps not entirely unjustifiably, a very bad reputation. The first races and beings to set foot on Na'erk, the gods and the Primordials, all believed that Zintizuctra was an invention of Veth himself, and that those who lived there wished for the destruction of the world.

The truth, however, is quite different. As the range of Vethians that created it was wide, those who stayed there could not agree on the most valid approach to determining who was fit to stay there and how to deal with the outside world. The result was that if someone strong enough thought that someone could pass, he passed, and slowly the place was filled with all kinds of creatures. Exiled ancient beings, criminals, fugitives, those seeking cover, and many other miscreants.

The place became known by many names. The land of broken chains, the dimension of infinite possibilities, the land of uncertainty. Among the patrons, there were frequent battles about who will dominate and who will have the hegemony there. This led to the reputation of the place getting even worse. However, no one dared to attack it, because besides the fact that the power of a creature that can create a dimension is not to be underestimated, from a moment on fragments of material crystallizations of Primordials had entered the dimension. It was in more and more in the interest of powerful beings to leave this place in peace and any attack would find serious opposition.

## Description

Not much can be described about the Scream Fields, because it is a dimension that goes through constant changes. Its chaotic nature is scattered throughout the dimension, and in its history there have been repeated conflicts there. It includes dense jungles, rough seas, tangled rivers and cliffs at every possible corner. The weather never stays constant for long, and often even the attitudes of the patrons change from one moment to the next.
