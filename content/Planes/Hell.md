## Formation

Hell was formed by [[Sergonial]] as an extradimensional rift in [[Tartara]], at the end of the [[Eternal Slaughter]]. He drew power from the slain Kenemi to make and fortify this place, and was inhabited by devils, the ex-[[Kenemi]].

## 9 Layers of Hell

The hierarchical structure that Sergonial had in mind when he left [[Yerastu]]'s service could only be applied to the layout of hell as it was created and evolved. So nine spherical shells were created in the dimension, one inside the other, each serving a different purpose and use. These shells move around the center of Hell, each of them charting their own path. Each crust is three to seven miles thick and is spaced from one to one hundred and forty miles apart. From outside to inside, they are:

**I. Cocitus, the Plunge.**

Cocitus is actually a waterfall that washes the water of the [[Styx]] into the underworld, ending in stagnant waters, rivulets and moats of dark hues. From here Hell communicates with the other dimensions, and souls arrive. Souls here are chosen according to their loyalty to the Sergonial and their oaths, or punished for their actions. The waters are teeming with amphibious and aquatic sentinels of varying sizes and shapes, a first taste of Hell. The cries of the souls create a tremendous noise in the waters, and the attacks of the devils only amplify it.
The Lord [[Dagon]] rules this place, who has two forms: one of a fish-man and one of a giant satanic octopus. Dagon has a very bad reputation within Hell and is relatively isolated, mainly because he was [[Raptazeal]]'s friend, and because he is considered by many to have similar ambitions for gaining power.

**II. Malfeus, the Fortress.**

Malfeus' massive fortress and wall form Hell's main line of defense against external threats. It includes a particularly thick and high wall, countless natural and magical traps at every possible point, infinite sentries and a huge army in the intermediate towers that are ready at any moment to meet any possible threat. The fortifications are constantly reinforced with raw materials from Pyroclasm, and after so many millennia the fortress has become literally impregnable. Souls who have been chosen or condemned to stay in hell pass through here. The fortress is a particularly quiet place, as it operates under very strict martial law, even though it is often chosen as a meeting point between devils.
The current lord is [[Bolas]], a Fiendfolk. He is mortal and the youngest of the nine. He is especially faithful and capable, as he often goes, as a mortal, to the [[Material Plane]] for various jobs. Bolas had recently replaced the previous lord, the ambitious Raptazeal, following a failed coup attempt by the latter in the year 4467. Raptazeal had closed all Malfeus' gates and threatened to block all soul traffic to and from Cocitus, and that he would raise a personal army to depose Sergonial. After a relatively short duel, he died a martyr's death. His skull is on display today in Sergonial's palace.

**III. Catharos, the Pit.**

The most disgusting and hideous part of hell is here. Catharos consists of infinite holes, chambers, prisons, caves and chasms, all of which have been made for one purpose: To punish the souls who renounced Sergonial, betrayed him or violated the terms of the agreement they had made with some devil. In any case, Lord Veiroch and the Painbringers have perfected every possible form of torture and imprisonment, and the place has been learned to be feared and avoided by almost everyone. This is where some of the lesser forms of devils are often created, from old souls who have exhausted the limits of their torment and need to metamorphose into something more practical and useful, often for the purpose of guarding and tormenting the remaining souls.

**IV. Yith, the Oblivion.**

The whole of Yith is, according to many, an illusion. A hodgepodge of fear, hate, uncertainty and madness, which morphs to match each visitor's greatest fears. Yith is intended for the punishment of devils and traitors by Sergonial's faithful, and exists to show that no one is above punishment, regardless of position. Few places cause so much fear in devils, and it is one of the main reasons that the majority of devils are so loyal and obedient. The lord of the place is unknown and unseen, but the few who do know say that he is a primal nightmare from the last period of the Primordial War. Those who refer to him call him Yith, and say that he has a close connection with the Dreamworld, and there are channels of communication with it in various parts of Yith.

**V. Typhon, the Eternal Storm.**

The place here is flat, with few windswept hills and constant bad weather. Winds, hurricanes, cyclones and storms are constantly taking place. At first it had few inhabitants, mostly wild beasts, but it was destined not to remain empty for long. Highness Glacya's arrival attracted many Erinyes, Nemesis and Shadow devils. Glacya was the first erinya, who was once an angel of Sigard and decided to convert when a sorcerer who summoned her to the material dimension asked her to kill the entire population of a village in Darrok to contain a contagious disease. Glacya has since ended up in Hell and has become one of Sergonial's most loyal and powerful followers, and is feared and shunned by most devils.

**VI. Pyroclasm, the Burning Fields.**

Volcanoes, lava and fires are a constant sight in Pyroclasm. Scorched earth, brimstone, smoke and coal make up the bulk of the place, as well as miners digging for rock, iron and precious stones. The mighty lord Geyron, a huge winged devil, is especially lenient to the devil visitors to the area. This means that devils of all kinds often come here to practice, trade, battle, or settle scores. Geyron has decreed that what happens in the Burning Fields stays in the Burning Fields, and his wish has been respected because of his power, but also because the place helps to decongest various tensions. Rumors that speak of the connection of the place with the quadrant of Fire have not been confirmed, although for many it is a common secret.

**VII. Atenn, the Halls of Trial.**

This is where the souls who were faithful arrive and their fate is decided, after being judged and passing some tests. If they fail and are found guilty of certain acts, they end up in the Pit. Otherwise, they are chosen for service, and become devil warriors, scribes, magicians, or whatever else, according to the soul's capabilities and the needs of the period. Each different function means a correspondingly and completely different hierarchy and type of devil. Lord of Atenn is Kalgar, a ruthless tyrant in steel armor from top to bottom, brandishing a chain and spiked whip.

**VIII. Galthar, the Infinite Forges.**

This is where ores and raw materials come from Pyroclasm, which are processed in forges and furnaces to make weapons, armor and various magical items, equipment, defensive devices and utility items. Often in the creation of the most powerful of these, doomed souls are used, absorbed by the objects during their creation. This occasionally results in objects having their own consciousness and personality, and communicating with their owner. In many places there are Gateways to other dimensions, which make it easier to trade all manufactured goods and transport raw materials.
Galthar is ruled by Lord Mammon, who is a hypertrophic devil, scribe and bureaucrat. Most of the other lords tend to look down on him, but despite his apparent indolence he has enormous power and political authority in his hands, as all of Hell's currency and transactions pass through his hands, directly or indirectly.

**IX. Avernus, the Devil City.**

Unlike the rest of the husks, Avernus is a beautiful city. Its buildings are huge and delicate, with bridges, ramps and reaching unimaginable heights, while most of them present a unique architecture and mentality. The roads are spotlessly clean and well-maintained, while the residents are particularly law-abiding. This city is, for many, the dream that Sergonial has for the material dimension: A beautiful place where everything works like clockwork. Here are his most chosen and loyal servants, as well as several mortals who either belong to the Kenorex or perform a specific function.
In the center is the majestic palace of Sergonial. It is guarded with the strictest security measures and is the largest and tallest building in the city, full of carved statues, frescoes and precious stones. Here Sergonial rules, and councils of the Nine Lords occasionally take place when some important matter arises.
