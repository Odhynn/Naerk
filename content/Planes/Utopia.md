Utopia is [[Sumril]]'s plane. This [[Primordial]], promotes the superiority of the spirit and tries to overcome the material world through meditation. It teaches spiritual elevation and absolute peace, leading to the empowerment of the spirit and the potential of the soul.

All of Sumril's devotees are here, each in a different form, according to the extent to which he has succeeded in achieving this exaltation. One may be just an ant here, while another a huge dragon. Many of the creatures here have exaggerated features, albeit symmetrical ones, as they feature the idiosyncrasies of each patron. The plane includes temples, castles, towering mountains, clouds and craggy monasteries and calm seas.

However, there is another, dangerous part of the plane: Utopia has two faces. The second is a warning that spiritual elevation has risks. This is the dangers of complacency, absolute and blind trust, absolute stagnation, apathy and detachment from the environment. There are pirates, bandits and looters, who periodically make inroads into the plane's harmonious part, attacking every unsuspecting victim. However, any such raid, as well as any external intervention of instability, finds the creatures of the plane united against it.
