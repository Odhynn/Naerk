## Creation

When [[Veth]] appeared in the material world, he quickly realized that with his power he could easily consolidate his position. In this quest for dominance, he made many and various allies with his magic, huge and powerful beings, also known as Vethralls. His battle with the [[Equalizer]] fundamentally shook every corner of creation, and in this conflict both sides mustered whatever allies they could find. At a time when the Equalizer seemed to be losing the battle, he sought help from the Elemental Lord of Air, [[Saekla]]. Saekla decided to helend his aid, but only after demanding from the Equalizer that his victory against the creatures of Veth would have material crystallization in the world. And the Balancer, under pressure, agreed.

Saekla's battle with the creatures Veth had made was brutal and colossal in scale. The storm that broke out scattered all sorts of animate and inanimate beings and debris in every possible direction, while the [[Oracle]] writes that even now pieces of it fall to the earth as a result of this clash. The Air Lord emerged victorious in this battle, and when the dust settled, he demanded a record of his victory. And this took the form of a new dimension, full of air and winds. But the Air Lord quickly realized the problem: if he travelled there to form it on his will, then he would be giving his brothers from the other elements the right to do the same, either in that same dimension or elsewhere. So he was forced to retire, sad that he could not intervene in his own dimension, but happy that at least the victory left him with something.

## First Inhabitance

On the other hand, the remaining creatures, whose power was still not inconsiderable, sought refuge from the total destruction that awaited them. And they found it, in a place that had just been created and no one had the right to interfere there: the Tartari. They were used as a base for many of the Vethralls, until ultimately their raids even prevented the [[Primrdials]]' effort to create life on Na'erk. The creatures made attacks and raids on the first beings of the world, and returned to the safety of their shelter. Then the [[Elemental Lords]], united as the Equalizer had stepped out of the picture, attacked the Tartari in a battle that went so far as to tear apart not only space, but dimensions and time as well.

To contain the beings there, the Elemental Lady of Earth, [[Gibba]], created huge walls of earth to envelop the entire plane. The walls were blackened from the skirmish, scratched by the claws of the monsters, but they held. And Gibba extended her influence inward, compressing the plane, filling it with earth and prisons. And it is said that then Saekla's hatred towards Gibba grew even deeper, even though there was a necessity for this intervention. The Elemental lords, victorious in the end, decided to leave this shattered and broken plane, full of blinding sandstorms, screams, storms, prisons and exiles.
But the influence of the Vethralls did not disappear. Some escaped, and slowly began to emerge from their burrows again and regain some of their old powers. Their efforts were successful, and soon many underground, bottomless and dark paths led to Tartarus. These pasasges finally found the [[Abyss]], where the fiendish depths became even more infected and spread out.

And thus the Styx merged with the Eternal Prison.
