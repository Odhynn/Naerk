Dark matter is pervasive throughout the Shadow plane. Some come into contact with Shadow Plane to produce supernatural effects, others are its captives, while most of its inhabitants are undead made from the Veil of Night. The Shadow plane communicates with [[Styx]], the river of oblivion, and the most powerful shadow devotees earn the right to visit its banks, fishing for suffering souls and feeding on their pain.
