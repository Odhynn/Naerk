## History

With the end of the third phase of the [[Primordial War]], the [[Equalizer]] had now realized the omnipotence of the [[Elemental Lords]]. As he intended to limit his interference, he had to find a way to ensure harmony between them. The battles that happened between them were very frequent, and this could create many problems in the [[Material Plane]]. So he called them all together and explained the problem and how it could be solved.

Since the Elemental Lords had no problem defeating the other [[Primordials]], the Equalizer was sure that there would be no interference from anyone else. However, with so many victories crystallized by them, the material plane, which at first had limits, was constantly expanding, and planets, stars and cosmic matter were added as a result of this conflict. It was impossible to banish them from it, but at the same time he had to restrain them, lest they destroy everything in a moment of their conflict.

The solution he proposed to them was relatively simple. They would create a ring, which would be at the boundaries of the [[Material Plane]] and communicate with it. This ring would grow, as the universe itself would expand as a result of their actions, thus their territory. The element of all four would be up to them to decide how it would be represented in the material dimension. However, to seal the deal, he gave each of the four a diamond. A powerful object that would ensure that each of them could have absolute power with their element, but at the same time would limit them from interfering in the material plane and from taking advantage of others. These were sealed by the lords and became known as [[Malgyra]].

The four Elemental Lords agreed with this decision, or so it seemed. Each took a quarter circle from the elemental ring and there developed their territory to the fullest. Since then the elemental ring has contained many unique places and creatures, and the points bordering their territories have created unique phenomena, from storms to ice, volcanoes and swamps. Before retiring, the Equalizer made it clear that the safekeeping of these items is particularly important, and disclaimed his responsibility.

For several millennia there was no particular disturbance in this balance. No one seemed to be able to disturb her, even after the creation of the [[Rod of Stone and Steel]]. 
However, when [[Attor]], the first giant, condemned his kin to servitude with [[Gibba]], the other lords revolted to her sudden increase in influence. Chaos ensued in the ring with constant fighting, that stopped only after several decades Attor pledged part of his kin to the other [[Elemental Lords]] too. Their wrath was finally quelled when [[Attor]] died and they split his soul into four pieces, each lord claiming a piece.

Later the [[Omniverse Tower Incident]] that scattered the [[Malgyra]] on the plane destabilised the volatile balance of the plane. According to [[Chandor]], who was present there, without [[Ashiro]]'s intervention the outcome of this would have been disastrous. But now, few know about this battle, and even fewer are willing to recount it.
