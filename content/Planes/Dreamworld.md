## Description

Dreamworld is the land of dreams, created by Hozetul. It includes nightmares, sleepwalkers, and all those who sleep, who on the plane appear as fireflies. If someone disturbs the fireflies, they disappear and the person wakes up. The only permanent residents here are nightmares, those who died from them, those in a permanent coma, and those who were able to supernaturally materialize here or become trapped. The vast majority are nightmares. During the creation of the plane, [[Hozetul]] disintegrated into infinite pieces, which became the nightmares.

Nightmares tend to change forms, depending on the dreams of fireflies. But they also have hierarchy, which limits them from acting uncontrollably. They are only allowed to attack in self-defense, meaning they are only truly dangerous against those who have passed into the dimension due to special circumstances, or those trapped there, as they are the only ones who can harm nightmares. They are also limited to one nightmare per firefly. Although most nightmares are malevolent, the dreamland itself is not hostile to anyone. Each patron has the ability to change the plane's geography with their thoughts, and no place there stays the same for long, except for recurring dreams, which are usually close to where the fireflies first appear when a sleeper begins to dream. Because nightmares cannot disappear, they simply change form when they come into contact with a firefly.

Many creatures who have traveled for a long time in the Dreamworld are often unable to define its beginning and end. Having spent so much time there, it is very easy for anyone to go crazy and lose that dividing line between reality and dream.

## [[Twalar]]

When Voolthow abused his friendship to [[Hozetul]] and sent his minions to infiltrate the Dreamworld, several nightmares resisted his influence. These attacks were unexpectedly successful because they specifically targeted only those who interfered with the unwritten rules of not meddling with the physical and spiritual state of the dreamers. Then, the more cowardly, found it in their best interest to ally with the nightmares, as they would escape Voolthow's control. And this alliance was called [[Twalar]]. Their results were multiplicative, as each invader they destroyed saved hundreds of mortals from their torment, and the more mortals Voolthow lost, the harder it was for him to invade the Dreamworld.

Soon Voolthow lost almost all the channels he had to send his dark magic to the Dreamworld. The Wayangs and those who had defected, however, were trapped in the world of dreams. And they knew that if they left thence, Voolthow would hunt them down and bend them to his will, since he punished some exemplarily. And the [[Twalar]] faced this problem in unison. They found ways to send some Wayang souls in the mornings when mortals awoke through dreams into the [[Material Plane]], and they settled there.
