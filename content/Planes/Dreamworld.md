Dreamworld is the land of dreams, created by Hozetul. It includes nightmares, sleepwalkers, and all those who sleep, who on the plane appear as fireflies. If someone disturbs the fireflies, they disappear and the person wakes up. The only permanent residents here are nightmares, those who died from them, those in a permanent coma, and those who were able to supernaturally materialize here or become trapped. The vast majority are nightmares. During the creation of the plane, Hozetul disintegrated into infinite pieces, which became the nightmares.

Nightmares tend to change forms, depending on the dreams of fireflies. But they also have hierarchy, which limits them from acting uncontrollably. They are only allowed to attack in self-defense, meaning they are only truly dangerous against those who have passed into the dimension due to special circumstances, or those trapped there, as they are the only ones who can harm nightmares. They are also limited to one nightmare per firefly. Although most nightmares are malevolent, the dreamland itself is not hostile to anyone. Each patron has the ability to change the plane's geography with their thoughts, and no place there stays the same for long, except for recurring dreams, which are usually close to where the fireflies first appear when a sleeper begins to dream. Because nightmares cannot disappear, they simply change form when they come into contact with a firefly.
