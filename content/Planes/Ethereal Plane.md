The Fifth Dimension, also known as the Spiritual Dimension or Ethereal Plane, is a creation of a [[Primordial]] group, led by [[Auromia]]. When the [[Equalizer]] defined space and time, Auromia found a gap in his design, and that was the soul. The soul is not defined in space and remains indestructible with the passage of time. Thus, it created a dimension that exists alongside the material, the Ethereal Plane. Through this, matter can be bypassed, so that one can travel wherever they want in the Material Plane. Thus, she made a whole, immaterial world, which comes into contact with the material, ignoring the four elements. The only things that can harm an incorporeal are the Light of [[Veth]] (magic), materials from the early stages of the [[Primordial War]], or something equally powerful and ancient.
