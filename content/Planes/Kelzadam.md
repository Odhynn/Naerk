## Creation

Kelzadam is a dimension created on the [[Elemental Ring]] after [[Gibba]] fought [[Fyrlean]]. The place was torn from this clash of colossal proportions. It was broken and full of melted stones and metals, and fire everywhere, and it is said that this is when lava and magma were first created. After a while, the fighting stopped, for even Fyrlaen in his arrogance realized that he was risking everything if he continued this war.

## Inhabitance

For a long time, many elemental spirits walked upon this new dimension. Several of those who came from Gibba, among them [[Klont]], found themselves trapped there. The war outside was raging and it was not easy for them to leave the safety provided by the shelter of this dimension. Since they were therefore trapped, under the leadership of Klont they decided to shape the dimension to their own specifications.

And just like that, this battered place slowly began to take shape and substance. Volcanoes, fires and lava were confined to certain places. The cracks closed and most of the battle marks slowly disappeared. Klont, with the help of [[Vard]], [[Kromlek]] and [[Hedbba]], didn't stop there though. Centered on the dimension's largest volcano, also known as [[Ramlog]], he built a forge, and in the middle, pouring hot lava and molten metals, he placed an anvil. And from there, he started making weapons, and that's how he became known as the Blacksmith. Vard took huge chunks of stone, and built thick and towering walls and stabilized the volcano with sturdy pillars. Kromlek took the weapons and armed all the plane's patrons, and taught them how to use them. And Hedbba took it upon herself to scout and watch for enemies and dangers. Especially in the first period, the invaders were a constant threat, but the inhabitants were determined, resolute and well armed. To ensure the safety of the place, they built war machines on the walls, and stone giants that destroyed the attackers. Somehow, they were able to endure.

## Creation of Dwarves

One day when Hedbba was scouting, he saw mist in a volcano tunnel. He followed it, and quickly reached its source: A huge underground river lay in the center of a large cavern, and the water bubbled up as it made contact with the lava, creating a hot cloud.
When he informed the others of what he had found, Klont called them all to his anvil. When they gathered, he explained to them that this river was the [[Styx]], which connected all dimensions with the [[Material Plane|material one]]. At that moment, Hedbba, not heeding his words, jumped while running back and forth on the bellows, and a sudden wind blew on a creation of Klont. Everyone was speechless for a moment, and then the craft appeared to walk on its own, without commands.
The four of them looked at each other uncertainly, not knowing what to do. Then he spoke, and they understood that with the blow, a soul had passed into this body, with a single sign of life.
*"I don't understand" Klont then said. "So many years I've been making these, with the exact same bellows, and they were nothing but mindless objects that took orders."*
There was silence. Then, in a slow voice, Vard, the observant builder, spoke, and his voice echoed through the hall. *"You have spent a long time at the smithy, my friend, and very well you have done, for without your efforts we could not have endured the dangers around us. But this effort hardened you like the metal you strike, and put out of your mind every emotion. But Hedbba did the exact opposite. He went out into the world, came in contact with many different creatures. He knew love, hate, anger, fear, pleasure, life. We here, put a stone in our hearts and painted our faces black. The world has moved on, and this here, a dwarf I shall call him, indicates it. [[Malahir]] gave life, and it has come this far."*
Klont, after too long, let his hammer, the first hammer, fall. He sat by his anvil in contemplation, looking at his creation that had come to life. *"You are right, my friend. But then what will become of the dwarf?"*
*"There is a solution"* Kromlek then took the floor. *"Malahir, life, is everywhere, but it did not come here by accident. Styx, and this wind, come from [[Na'erk]]. The souls of living beings are now tested there. The battle for creation and destruction is waged there: In the material dimension. There it will be judged whether the dwarf's soul was right, wrong or random. And that will not happen by itself. It is up to it, by its actions to prove it."*
Then, they made a huge chain, and at the end of it, they put an anchor, and the dwarf, with the rudimentary intelligence he had managed to acquire, was chained there. The four of them dropped the anchor into the Styx, and saw that one by one the rings disappeared into the water. Then with a copper hammer they hammered the end of the chain into the rock of the mountain. And once they saw that the dwarf reached the material dimension, they saw that the chain did not follow him.
*"See? I told you so."* said the builder. *"The dwarf has now escaped from us, and is living his own life."*
*"He can't stand alone, though."* Said Hebdda, *"Others are needed, too."*
And just like that, their tasks were defined. Klont, to forge the dwarven soul shell. Hebdda to give them personality with the bellows. Kromlek guarded all the chains, and reinforced them whenever a dwarf needed help, or pulled them back when he died. Finally, Vard took it upon himself to control the other three: Klont, so that he wouldn't make more souls than was needed. Kromlek, so that he does not needlessly pull on the chains. And little Hebdda, to curb his enthusiasm.
And so, the dwarves walked upon Na'erk.
