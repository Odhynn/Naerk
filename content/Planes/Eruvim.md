A demiplane created by Sylris during the fall od the Edhellin. Its a colorless, odorless, weightless dimension, surrounded by incredible amounts of energy. The demiplane's gravitational pull is tens of times that of Naerk, and time on it has absolutely no meaning - practically, timeless, with no exits or entrances. This demiplane created an unstable planar rift that was eventually sealed by [[Yerastu]].
