The Void Plane is the creation of [[Yast]]. The Void plane includes all sorts of fantastic things in its environment, many of which are incomprehensible or seem useless at first glance. But the environment is particularly hostile to anyone who comes from the material dimension and is there, and attacks and restricts him. It contains a huge uncharted area that some sages claim contact even other places of the [[Material Plane]], unreachable to most.

The creatures and environment of the Void plane are as strange and otherworldly as one's mind can conceive, and most of them, like their environment, are hostile to anything of material existence, being, or object. The laws of nature don't work here, and all creatures seem to obey an entirely different set of rules beyond all science and magic. They have mixed feelings towards the material plane, as most cannot bear the painful reminder that they lost in the Primordial War. However, they respect the spirits themselves and often welcome them when they come to the Null plane if they have permanently left their material existence. Some of them are full of quriosity, mixed with an aura of diffused danger.
