_"Ever get the feeling you did not prepare enough teleportation magic for the day?"_ he addressed her discreetly with a weary glance.
[[Shizu]] cocked an eyebrow.
_"Well, I do"_ replied [[Aldastrio]] to his own question, turning to face forward again. _"All the fuckin' time."_
Over there in the short distance, no more than half a thousand paces away, rising above the clouds was the next lead to their quest. The Temple of the Four Winds. So close. But nothing was ever simple, and the ragged company of four just had to find themselves on the wrong side of its walls during a siege.
The trojan banter between the [[Queen Ralvia|queen of the cloud giants]] and the [[Rikisol|raptoran warrior]] atop the walls went on. The former attempting to use the four intruders and the temple's captured knight as bartering pieces. The latter insisting there was no way he was going to yield anything to the giants, come whatever may.
The position of Shizu and her companions stood delicate indeed.
"Seems negotiations are not going well. Plan A?" whispered Aldastrio.
Shizu studied for a last brief instance the humongous bows hung on the backs of the giants standing all around them and closed her eyes in recognition of the necessity.
_"Be as it may."_
_"Okay, you guys get ready and wait for my mark."_
As Aldastrio observed the discussion for the right moment to interject, Shizu cautiously relayed the course of action to her comrades, so as not to be taken notice of by the surrounding hulking giants.
_"Breaking through, as we discussed, allright?"_
[[Droghor]] nodded his head affirmatively, while the ghoul than once was Domovoi regarded her with a crooked grin.
_"Eyes on Aldastrio"_ whispered Shizu at last and turned her eyes once more to the temple gates, farther along the clouds.
Storm was brewing, in more ways than one. That tingling, peculiar sensation. The tension in the air. The anticipation. That particular eerie feeling that made the hands of even the most seasoned veterans tremble.
Not hers though. Not her hands, not her heart, not a fiber in her being quivered with either concern or glee for the imminent battle. She was calm. As ever. And that's what always unnerved her the most.
Those moments. Those tense, terrifying moments. In a minute's time, she should not even have the time to think. In a minute's time, she would be fighting for her life. In a minute's time she could be dead. 
How could that not concern her? Why did she always have to be so cold, so serene?
How was that even human?
_"Excuse me!"_ Aldastrio's voice roused her from her contemplation. The heads of the surrounding cloud giants turned to the elf mage as he suddenly hijacked the ongoing banter between the giant queen and the raptoran defender.
_"If I may contribute SOMETHING of essence to this terribly stagnant conversation..."_ he said aloud before pausing for the punchline.
I'll have to speak to him later on the element of surprise, thought Shizu.
_"NOW!"_ shouted Aldastrio and started running towards the gate.
It begins. "The grace of [[Yerastu]] protect me. FORM A LINE!" Shizu yelled as all four of them sprinted forward, as she reached in her backpack for her new shield.

A minute later she had made it. Still alive. They were inside the gates, out of breath but safe.
And they had lost [[Domovoi]].
Amid the torrent of thought, memories, and emotions that rushed through her mind, voices, here and there. The defenders of the keep were talking. The dialogue almost flew over her head. The voices, how did they matter, why?
What's it all for?
And then the voices stopped with a thunder.
The last words she had picked up from all that still rang in her. "Storm is brewing".
Attempting to humour her grief, she chuckled, inwardly, wearily, about the fact somebody had stolen her personal metaphor. To herself. To her blade, who could also hear her thoughts.
But [[Shiji-Sha|Shiji]] was not up for discussion. He had something else he wanted to talk about this time. The cryptical kind of talk.
Shizu would cock an eyebrow. If she could.
