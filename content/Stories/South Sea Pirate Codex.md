## South Sea Pirate Codex

This is the Pirate Codex of the [[Whistor]] pirates and of [[Flame Gulf]], and the Southern Trade Route:

**-Part of the Ship, Part of the Crew. Everyone on board the ship is considered part of the crew. Otherwise, they are treated as an enemy, intruder or booty (slave). All crew members are obliged to contribute to the protection and management of the ship.**

**-Part of the Crew, Part of the Loot. The loot belongs to the entire crew and is shared equally.**

**-Head of the Ship, Head of the Crew. The captain of the ship is also responsible for the fate of the crew.**

**-Head of the Fleet, Head of the Ship. The captain of the fleet is also responsible for each ship that makes up it separately.**

**-Part of the Crew, Weapon in Hand. All crew members are required to fight wherever and whenever necessary.**

**-Gold with Blood. Disloyalty with Death. Theft, whether from loot or gambling, is punished exemplary and violently. Treason and desertion lead to even heavier punishments, all of which lead to death.**

**-Left the Crew, Left to the Sea. Any other act that leads to the removal of crew membership means immediate disembarkation from the ship.**

**-Part of the Crew beyond Death. The crew remains loyal until death and beyond. Their secrets, service and trust continue beyond any obstacle.**

**-Crew Dispute, End on Spot. Disputes are resolved immediately, violently if necessary, and are not repeated.**

**-Captain Kill, First on Loot. Whoever kills the captain of an enemy ship gets the first share of the loot.**

**-First Kill, Second on Loot. Whoever kills the first enemy ship's sailor gets the first share of the loot.**

**-First to Spot, Third on Loot. Whoever spots the first enemy ship gets the third share of the loot.**

**-Bound to the Ship, Chained on the Shore. Crew attributes do not begin or end on the ship, but extend to periods of looting, disembarking, or relaxing on shore.**
