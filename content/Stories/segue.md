“Soo, that’s that. How about it?”
“Nope.”  
“Come onnn, we ‘re paying good money” insisted the redhead girl.  
The dwarf snapped his head up from his work table, widely grinning, and let pass a short dramatic pause. “Nope!” he finally said and dove his face right back over his vials and notes.  
“Is that a ‘nope’ as in ‘nope you are not paying good money’ or ‘nope, too hazardous’?”  
“Nope as in ‘nope’.”  
“Uuurgh, droch áird chúgat lá gaoithe...”  
The young mage rubbed her forehead in exasperation. “Sorry to have to bother you Mr. [[Mordrydd]], but you could save us a lot, and I emphasise, a lot of time and effort. Your expertise is critical-”  
“Yes, yes, to make that useless stuff into divine-level skin cream for what ails ye to address some obscure shit in a vague faraway world, swords that glow when they sniff it, yadda yadda yadda” Mordrydd interjected in a cheerful tone. He glanced at the bastard sword hung on the witch’s back, sensing its curious humming with suspicion and badly hidden interest.  
“Colour me curious. Morghonljucht dagger ‘s not up for sale though, and I am not about to scour the North for more of that fucking mineral, [[Aileen|Ginger]].”   He paused, and his eyes rolled over the snowy hills and dewy grass far over the rooftops, and along the muddy streets of [[Kranårvikk]] and the icy sheets of the river hiding its flowing waters below.  
“I mean, this is a good spot now, innit? The big white North! Pristine, whimsical, charming...” he mused, before the brawling noises reached their ears. Across the riverbank a colourful ruckus flared as a rowdy company of northmen burst forth from an inn, laughing and hooting as they carried above their heads a bewildered bearded man and tossed him with a great heave into the river.

“Charming” repeated wryly the black cat familiar hovering by the girl’s shoulder over the sounds of joyful vulgarity coming from across the bank.  
“I know, right?” said an amused [[Mordrydd]], “my Fishes are a hearty bunch, to be sure. I have acquired an elite clientele, from [[Jarl Bugril]]’s [[Folegg|sickly kid]] to the drunkard that just took a dive over there. Big plus, they do not mind when I cause one too many...” he made a gleeful blow-up gesture, “...explosions! I’m right fine where I stand, right here, right now. Might have taken you up on yer offer once, but I'm going through a settled-down phase at the moment. So, yeah... nope.”  
The cat grinned thoughtfully and whispered a few unintelligible words in its mistress’s ear. The girl mulled over them for a second and glanced back at the dwarf.  
“Well, I suppose I should be glad for you finding your place...” She paused for effect. “Especially this far from home.”  
A tiny yet visible bit of Mordrydd’s grin evaporated.  
“Ah, yeah, excuse me. Forgot to mention. I did knock on their door too” added the mage girl, pretending not to notice she had struck a nerve. “The Emberbeard Clan Hold of [[Thurskogen]], while I was studying for a few months in the Hall of Skalds in [[Spøkkeborg]]. Needless to say, they were not very eager themselves, even though Morgonljucht is supposed to be their shtick.”  
The dwarf eyed the young mage inquisitively, his attention having drifted entirely away from his vials. “It IS their shtick” he finally said, suddenly serious, “that’s why they won’t hand it to a stranger. They can’t have a stranger milk something out of the bloody Morgonljucht now, can they?” He shook his head as he tried to bury his dwarven nose back into his notes.  
“Nope. Better any practical use of the dumb stuff remain in research limbo forever than someone else beating them in their own game, I guess” he murmured. “Abraar Emberbeard’s descendants toiled for generations to unlock its huge potential, and their efforts were marred with failure and disappointment. After all that, as far as the clan is concerned, it wouldn’t do to give it all up, even under the ‘pretext’ of outsourcing or collaboration, no...” He glanced back up at the girl. “No, that’s not their way. If the Clan can’t make something out of the damn thing, then no one should.”  
“But what if YOU were the one to jumpstart the Morgonljucht research again?” tried the girl. “You’re one of the clan.”  
“Debatable” sighed the dwarf. “Why do ya think I had to come here to ‘find my place’ in the first place?” Mordrydd looked into the girl’s eyes, and she could see it was a deep pot of story she had stirred.  
“Apologies, master dwarf” tried her familiar, in a baritone voice atypical of a cat, “we didn’t mean to pry.”  
“Nay, it’s fine. The clans can hold on to their honour for as long and as tightly as they wish, no matter the cost, the years, the waste, no matter which side of the [[Draugrelfr River]] they might sit” said the dwarf as he gazed vaguely westward, far over the shacks of [[Kranårvikk]].  
“The clans of the dwarf-lords in their hallowed mountains;” recited the redhead witch, “the clans of the warrior-poets in their misty woods; the clans of the eternal sentinels in the [[Harrowlands]] where the shadows lie. The price they have all paid for ‘honour’ is steep and most of the time unnecessary, I know.”  
“Aye...”  

A solemn silence passed between them for a moment or two.  
“...How ‘d ye know where to find me anyway? Do my esteemed kin still keep tabs on me?” Mordrydd finally spoke.  
“Heather told me” smiled the girl. “She says ‘hi’, by the way.”  
“How is she? Still perpetually high on jarl grey tea?”  
“Even more so since the abomination clusterfuck.”  
“Hrahahach. Hah. Well” chuckled Mordrydd, “my answer’s still nope. But let me say this much: if I ever get tired of my Fishes, I shall consider taking your mad project on.”  
“Thank you; this much is good for now; if you ever do, send a raven” replied the girl, taking a closed envelope out of her backpack and placing it on Mordrydd’s worktable.  
“Alright then, Ginger” nodded the dwarf. “See you around.”  

The young witch gestured discreetly with hand over heart and set off down the muddy streets, leaving the dwarf thoughtful over the envelope laid on his desk, beside his Morgonljucht-inlaid dwarven clan dagger. He stared blankly for a while at the weapon, that had been forged the day he was born, not his choice to make, but nevertheless his choice to keep. Was it, at the end of the day, a tether that winded far over the shacks of that town, far longer than the banks of that river? Why was it that instead of the arcing longhouse rooftops, flowing torrents and muddy pathways of [[Kranårvikk]], he could now see the towering stone manors, intricate cobblestones and endless little bridges over the endless little streams of [[Thurskogen]]?
He calmly, absently cleared some space on the worktable for his elbows, restedhis chin on his hands, and let out a sigh.
