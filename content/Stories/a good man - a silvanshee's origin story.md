## A Good Man
a silvanshee’s origin story

He could remember little of what he’d dreamed of, save a little moment, just a blink. He remembered light through foliage. The slow ﬂapping of wings. The whispers of a faraway song. [[Felix]] could not for the life of him understand why this particular moment remained strong beyond his subconscious and into his waking moments, in such a way, in such a nagging presence. Maybe it had to do with the changeling girl they had apprehended yesterday? Was she not in the dream too? He wasn’t sure. He was a strongly-built fellow, Felix Mason. A gentle giant, his ellow soldiers called him sometimes.Even though he’d seen much in his life of service, it never seemed to bring him down. He would look at thelatest odd thing their lie would slap them with and crack a crude dry joke, be it the mud, the ood, the idiocyo their superiors, and even their chances at a grisly and/or unny death. Tat’s why they liked him. He even joked about his perpetual status o candidacy or knighthood, and how the rest o the knights,mostly nobles, seemed to be content to just dangle it in ront o his eyes or ten years. It was all un and games ‘round the ﬁreplace, but deep down, this, in particular, was an ever-presentitch at his mind. Tose who called themselves ‘knights’ seldom deserved their damned title and their damnedtithe, and yet there they were. “Damn their eyes” he would mutter, alone in his post. “Damn their eyes.” oo ofen, after witnessing the horrors o war, he would stand in ront o the mirror before he shaved,and study his reﬂection; admitting to himsel that he was no ‘Sir’ yet, but he was still, despite everything, agood man. And so the ten years became ﬁfeen, and ﬁfeen became twenty. In that span o time, he had learnedhis amily back home had not managed to survive, and he still had not been cleared or knighthood. I he had,he wondered, would things have been diﬀerent? Could he have saved them? His jokes turned sullen and cynical with the passage of time.It was yet another hot, humid dawn in that damned tropic region. Morning call. Ammo count.Reviewing the shifs. Checking the repairs. Laundry. As the hours ﬂew relatively idly in the Imtarian camp,Felix still elt uneasy about the changeling girl. When his unit had ound her in the jungle, she had not given a single word o reply to their inquiries.O roughly ten years o age, her silent expression, coupled with the mismatched coloured eyes prevalent inthe hag-children, was at least eerie. Sir Merren had decreed that she might be one o the children spies the insurgents used, and thus theyshould take the girl to camp. It was not sae or her out there anyway, and Felix had ound that hard to arguewith as he picked her up like a eather and sat her in his saddle. All the way back to the camp, the girl hadremained silent, though her eyes took in everything with great wonder. Felix could not help but think about how his own baby daughter might have been her age by now. What’s on the menu today? “Not that gruel again,” he blurted upon seeing their midday meal, tray inhand. “We should check i there are any horses missing again. Sure as hell hope they ‘re not gonna eed thisto the new kid, as well...” His ellow soldiers chuckled, yet he wondered i Sir Merren was giving the girl enough to eat; andpaused, realising he was worrying about the changeling again. Why was he worried so? What was it that hadn’t sat well with him? Was it the distant aching o his broken atherhood? Wasit something in the dream? Was it Sir Merren?
 
He stopped a while and mulled that last one over in his head. Now that Felix thought about it, Sir Merren did seem more intrigued about the changeling than theother children spies they had encountered. But how was that relevant? All those kids had been sent away tooster communities out o the war zone, as the policy o the Imtarian Army supposedly dictated. Same orher, Felix supposed? Still. Tat nagging eeling. Sir Merren sure had looked at the time like he really wanted to hear thechangeling speak. Was he hoping to learn about the hags? Curious, as the hags had stayed oﬀ the ray thus ar;they had not picked sides, nor were they seen, in the highland jungles below which the battles loomed. Whywould he want to know... Felix slammed his hand on the dining table out o the blue, and took oﬀ. Now this, this was unnervinghim way too much or some reason. He had to put his mind at ease. He marched oﬀ to the command buildings, walked through the damp oﬃce hallways, and knocked atSir Merren’s door. Tere was no response. Indisposed, then. Tere was a lot o things that might require his attention. But could it be that... Weighing the possibility, he walked out to check on the bunkers near the stables, where Sir Merrenused to interview and debrie people. As he approached the bunker, in a relatively quiet area o the camp, a mounting eeling o dreadwashed over him. He wiped his brow, soaked with sweat born o worry and heat. His pace slowed not in the least. Why, why was he so unnerved, he thought to himsel. What couldpossibly be wrong? Te answer came as he heard a child’s whimper echo up rom the underground corridor. Cursing at his intuition or being correct
again, he stormed down the steps and loudly slammed openthe door at their end. Sir Merren, standing beside his desk strewn with maps, turned around to look at him calmly. Techangeling girl was sniﬄing beore him, sitting awkwardly on a chair, elbows grazed and cheeks bloody romthe impact o too many blows. “Sergeant Mason” said Sir Merren “what kind o manners are these? Are you looking or some days of potato-peeling duty, perhaps?” Felix was lost or words. “Are you... Are you mad, Sir?” he managed. “Are you
actually torturing the girl?” “I hear it is necessary for this expedition. She has been stubborn as you please, and I believe it is vitalinormation she’s withholding rom me.” “Is... is she working for the insurgents?” “No, I don’t think she is. But, I do know she’s with the hag coven in the western highlands.” “Te
hags
!?” Felix blurted incredulously. “What does this outﬁt care about the hags?” “Tey are creatures o evil, sergeant” maintained Sir Merren “and the way the board shifs, they’llstand against us beore long. Perhaps they already do. Or are you unconcerned about the latest rumours owitchcraf we hear about around the coven’s tur, rom the orward patrols stationed there?” “Sir Merren, please realise...” pleaded Felix, though the tension in his voice was less than deensive. “I am talking acts, sergeant!” the knight snapped. “Tose witch monsters have it out or us, and thislittle brat here knows!” He turned to the changeling and pushed a ﬁnger, accusingly, against her orehead. “And won’t tell.” “Mama...” bawled the girl helplessly, snot running rom her bloody nose. “You cooperate and tell me what your mama’s at, little whore” he barked in her ace “and you get tosee her again!”
 
“Sir Merren!” Felix’s grips tightened around themselves. “Tis behaviour does not become the Imtarian Army; nor does it become a knight o your stature.” “And what would you
know” Sir Merren spat back at him “o what becomes a knight? War is hell.Tere are things that must be done. Tings that are deemed necessary or the common good.” Felix’s chest heaved, in vain trying to contain whatever emotion was swelling there. “Tis outﬁt, this army, beats with one heart, one voice” barked Sir Merren, “the voice o the knight-oﬃcers. Te voice o Knighthood! And it’s this voice that will decide what does, and what does not becomethe army! What’s lef afer this voice is silenced, sergeant? Chaos!” Felix’s arms tightened, his knuckles white with tension.“And you should know that by now.” Sir Merren’s tone dropped with a sly smile. “But I guess, aferall, that is why you never made knight.” It’s not that he had not known or a long time what manner o scum populated the ranks o theknights, Felix realised. He had known all along. He had seen it. He had seen everything. wenty long years. And yet, he always wanted to reach their heights. ‘Sir Felix’. How hollow that sounded right now, tinged inthe words o this bastard whose status he aspired to. How vain. “But I did” continued Sir Merren. “I, am a knight. And you, sergeant, are a commoner; and a commoneryou will remain until the end o your days i you pester me any longer. Fall in.” Felix lowered his ﬁery glance to the ground, and shut his eyes. Would he still be a good man the nexttime he looked at himsel at the mirror? He said nothing as Sir Merren turned his back on him to look down on the changeling girl. “Did you get that, little hag?” he spat condenscendingly at her. “I am a knight. A ‘Sir’.” Te girl trembled yet did not look away. Her eyes still ound the courage to study Sir Merren as heraised his hand. “And you” he said, “you are a bitch!” He slapped her once. “You are a witch!” He slapped her twice. “You are-” “You are
no ‘Sir’...
” came a low voice behind him. Furious, he turned around, his mouth pursing to launch angry words into the air. It only launched teeth as it collided with Felix’s ﬁst.
It was yet another hot, humid afernoon in that damned jungle. “Are we there yet?” said Felix, his eyes scanning the surrounding hills. Te changeling girl said nothing, content to just point at a general direction. “Damn your eyes, you’re the one who’s supposed to go on with the are-we-there-yet thing here...” hemumbled, and urged their mount on. Swifly they rode through the vegetation on top o the horse Felix had busted out o the camp stables.Tey were ar rom camp, though they were sure to be ollowed. And as ar as alternative courses o actionwent, it didn’t get any better than this. Tere was no way that Felix was getting away with assaulting aknight. He did not bear high hopes in the prospect o surrender either; what Sir Merren did was not abovereproach, but out here they were ar rom the heart o Imtaria, and cold pragmatism was stronger thanhumane justice. Damned he would be i he allowed Sir Merren’s stock o knight-oﬃcers to get a kick out ocourt-martialling and hanging him. He paused and surveyed the landscape. Tey stood in the jungle highlands now, the places were theey held sway. Soon he’d have to let the horse go and continue on oot.
 
The changeling suddenly lifed up a ﬁnger and pointed somwhere among the trees uphill. Felixsquinted his eyes, and soon made out the silouette o a treehouse. “Mama” said the girl excitedly. He smiled broadly, relieved. Tey had made it. Te girl would be sae. And he would not need to let the horse go, afer all. Maybe he could escape the army. Leave this land. Go back home, or all that it was worth... Te changeling looked up at him with big mismatched eyes and urrowed brows. “...Why?” she asked innocuously. Felix was almost dumbstruck to hear a second unique word out o her. “What- what do you mean
why?
Why what?” he managed. “Why did you take me away rom your kind?” said the changeling. He ell silent or a moment. Hal-taken aback, hal-searching or an answer. “Because” he said meekly, “you are young. You are innocent o the evils o this world. You... you bearsuch promise, little doll.” “You can be so much more...” he sighed, “than me.” Te girl had just graced him with a smile when the sound o parted oliage reached his ears. He looked behind in alarm or a brie moment beore turning orward and lashing their horse withthe reins. Tey darted through the trees as more riders entered their sight. “Damn their eyes, they’ve caught up! I thought the river would be enough to throw them oﬀ! Damnmy eyes too!” Felix cursed under his breath as the horse sprinted, ducking to avoid rogue branches in his way.“I hope you did enjoy our heartwarming moment there, because,
boy
how does time ﬂy!” Without warning, the horse let out an anguished neigh and collapsed afer three arrows lodgedthemselves in its back. Felix was sure he’d heard two metallic
clanks
behind his ears at the same time, and astheir alling mount dropped them onto the ground, he told himsel how
oh so glad he was for the shield he had hung on his back. He got to his feet fast, and yanked the girl up as well. He looked to the riders below, then to thetreehouse above. In an instant, drawing upon years of tactical decisions, he knew what should be done.Pushing the changeling girl uphill, he took a stand in the middle o the path and unastened the shield romhis back. “Go! Run!” he urged her on, his voice decisive and grim. “Get to your Mama, ast! I’ll keep those bastards oﬀ you!
Go!”
The girl spared him and the riders ast approaching behind one rightened glance beore she sprintedthrough the oliage, where arrows could not see. Felix turned, sword and board in hand, and regarded the men that would kill him, that he would kill.Tey were Imtarians, like him. Tey had served in the same army, in the same company as him, and bound totheir orders. Was he prepared to shed the blood o his ellow countrymen, whom he had no bee with, to buythat one hag-child some time? Ten again, what kind o soldiers did he have bee with at all? If those were the insurgents galloping towards him with lances drawn, would it be diﬀerent? At least the insurgents would have the good sense not to brave the jungle hills with cavalry, hethought. Wait, was that oﬀ the moral topic at hand? Eh, damn it all. wo o the riders charged on him, screaming as they did. Parrying the ﬁrst’s lance aside, with shieldand body Felix ‘the gentle giant’ rammed into the horse, toppling both rider and mount into the dust. Asthe second one came in, he ducked to dodge the blow while driving his blade tip down into the ground andlunged, grabbing him by the leg and pulling him under in one tremendous motion. He turned, pulled hissword up from its temporary earthen sheath and down on the allen rider, one stab, two. Te rest o the horsemen bore down on him. Some struggled to ride through the vegetation, some gave up and dismounted, drew blades, and surrounded the lone warrior in close melee. “Damn you all to hell!” he bellowed in rage as his blade swung in every direction, drawing blood andpainting the air with it. Up and down went the blades, to and ro. Struck low in the leg, he dropped to one knee, andimmediately stood up again, cursing and swinging. Another cut, another blow, another strike to the back. Aew strides urther, a knight-oﬃcer in shining armour atop his steed looked on. Felix ought his hardest. He ought his last. Lef and right, to and ro, the steel, the screams went,until bloodied and out o breath, he dropped to both knees. Tree swords drove deep into his ﬂesh, and there was a ﬁnal pause in the mayhem. He murmuredsomething under his breath, blood dripping at his last words, and keeled over sideways, alling lieless on theground. “Get the hag-spawn” snarled the knight-oﬃcer, and those still on their eet mounted up and spurredtheir horses uphill to ﬁnd the girl among the green, yet the horses would reuse to take one more steptowards the glade ahead. Te knight barked ten words’ worth o orders and the men climbed oﬀ, then all othem rushed ahead on oot. Out o breath, step by step, warily, wearily they came within near sight of the treehouse, and suddenly halted. Te changeling was there. But so were the hags. An entire coven, glowering at them rom above,looking as gnarled and wicked as the wooden staves they held. Tere was a slow, verdant hiss spreading around the glade. Te voice o creatures o the ﬁrst world,ey moving in the shadows unseen.

“...Why?” said the girl again. But her voice was diﬀerent. Te leaves around the soldiers rose up and swirled in a sudden breeze. Te air pulsed. Teir aces rozein horror, and a collective gasp was abruptly silenced.
It was yet another cool, comforting nightfall in that enchanted glade. A resh, simple grave was dug there. The denizens of that primal place had gathered to lay upon it a ﬂower, a cup of mountain tea, a tooth, a coin, a chestnut. A little red cedar tree was planted to mark the ﬁnal resting place of one they considered their own. Did they truly know him though? “Who was he?” words unspoken drifed through the twilight. A little changeling girl at the front, soft mismatched eyes glistening, gave voice to as simple an answer as she could give. “A good man.” And carried with these words, unseen, unheard, there was something else. Light coming through foliage. Te slow ﬂapping of wings. The whispers of a faraway song.
