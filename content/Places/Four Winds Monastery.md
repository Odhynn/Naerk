Atop [[Tarhelm]]'s highest peak, above the clouds, lie the foundations of the Monastery of Four Winds. Few knÎ¿w of its existence, since the ascent to this secluded peak was particularly difficult. A few monks, warriors and priests live there, who perceive the isolation and adverse conditions as a unique opportunity to develop their physical and spiritual background. Many wild creatures of the mountain guarded the upper passages, but above all, they were a race of Cloud and Mist Giants, who until recently had been on friendly terms with the inhabitants of the monastery. It is said to be built in ages unknown, and contains rare scrolls and books with knowledge forgotten or forbidden, as well as powerful artifacts. Its guardians are handpicked one by one by the leaders of this establishment, including [[Oracle]], and several high priests. The extreme cold and altitude require extraordinary attunement for the inhabitants. There is a huge crows' nest, containing flocks of giant eagles and ravens, that often act as protectors and messengers to the monastery.

The once-good relations with nearby cloud giants were broken during [[War of the Titan]] and the resulting siege ended with casualties from both sides. The priests tried to slowly restore these relations after the hostilities ended.
