The seat of the emperor of [[Imtaria]] and previously [[Kultaria]] and a city of unique marvel. The castle walls have been tested in both [[Winter's War]] and [[Brothers War]], with negligible damage. It encompasses one tenth of the city and is directly feeded water for the moats and the city by the [[Arcanal]] aqueduct.
