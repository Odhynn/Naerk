A beautiful forest full of enchanted trees centuries old. It has many fey creatures and is forbidden to most commonfolk and outsiders.

When [[Talyrian]] left [[Kelonarie]], the branches on the trees leaned down, and the leaves fell. Even the plants seemed to cry in her absence, and a mist covered the forest, said to be from the tears of its creatures. And the forest has since become known as the Forest of Tears.
