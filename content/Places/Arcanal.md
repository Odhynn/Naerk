Arcanal is a wonder constructed during the peak of [[Imtaria]]. It is an artificial river and aqueduct from the constructed [[Goldenmist Deposit]] and [[Kaelyn Deposit]] from water of the [[Kisstalon]] and [[Colstaron]] mountain ranges. A unique architectural and engineering marvel like no other, arcanal can manually flood or drain, and can be used for defensive purposes, for agriculture, for shipyard docks and has numerous other applications.
