Arcanal is a wonder constructed during the peak of [[Kultaria]] and is considered one of its greatest engineering projects. It is an artificial river and aqueduct from the constructed [[Goldenmist Deposit]] and [[Kaelyn Deposit]] from water of the [[Kisstalon]] and [[Colstaron]] mountain ranges. A unique architectural and engineering marvel like no other, arcanal can manually flood or drain, and can be used for defensive purposes, for agriculture, for shipyard docks and has numerous other applications. It is able to provide water through a series of dams and canals to the entire southern plain and is one of the main reasons why the country can maintain and feed such a large population and army.
