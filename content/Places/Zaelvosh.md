A forest in north [[Kambah]]. A gate was opened here by those who defied [[Karahath]] to summon aid from [[Veiroch]] and dispose him. They called one of his strongest servants, [[Lovarnian]], a half-fiend tormentor who everyone trembled in his presence. He built a fortress there, [[Cossick]], in which he began torturing people and trading the information he learned. Cossick was built upon a village of elves that lived there, and hardly any elves survived the torture of being captured after an unequal battle.
