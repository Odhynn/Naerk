The island of Rondorvick defines the end of the [[Angry Sea]] and the beginning of the [[Misty Sea]]. Many believe that it simultaneously sets another boundary, between culture and nature. The waves here crash wildly, carving strange shapes into the secluded rocks. This rather inhospitable island, however, for some inexplicable reason is one of the most frequent destinations for many travelers, druids and hermits.

Bare rocky terrain prevails throughout the island. To the south there is a small forest, consisting of low trees and bushes, as the frequent winds, cyclones and tornadoes tend to bring down anything that tries to emerge on its own. Animals are few, and all attempts to populate the place have led only to a sheltered port, full of seals, which lies in the shadow of the Raven's tower. Exceptions are the endless flocks of birds, as well as the famous and effeminate Falcons of Rondor, which have a wingspan of more than forty feet and are greyish in color.

Those who sit in this place for more than a month begin to develop a special kind of respect for it. The wild aspect of the place attracts many druids, who strive to realize their abilities and tame the elements of nature. Some travelers choose this place to find solitude, while the island's only settlement to the south, Windreach, is made up of fugitives, monks, wanderers, exiles, and even a few escapees from the demon-infested [[Olgizmar]].

The tower itself is a unique landmark. The smooth black granite that juts out from the steep northern shores culminates in a huge pinnacle, full of holes and hollows, where falcons, albatross and other seabirds come and go. It also serves as a gathering place for druid circles, primarily [[Fismint]].
