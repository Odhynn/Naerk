The island of Rondorvick defines the end of the Wild Sea and the beginning of the Sea of Mist. Many believe that it simultaneously sets another boundary, between culture and nature. The waves here crash wildly, carving strange shapes into the secluded rocks. This rather inhospitable island, however, for some inexplicable reason is one of the most frequent destinations for many travelers, druids and hermits.

Bare rocky terrain prevails throughout the island. To the south there is a small forest, consisting of low trees and bushes, as the frequent winds, cyclones and tornadoes tend to take with them anything that tries to emerge on its own. Animals are few, and all attempts to populate the place have led only to a sheltered port, full of seals, which lies in the shadow of the hawk's tower. Exceptions are the endless flocks of birds, as well as the famous and effeminate Falcons of Rondor, which have a wingspan of forty feet and are greyish in color.

Those who sit in this place for more than a month begin to acquire a special kind of respect for him. The wild aspect of the place attracts many druids, who strive to realize their abilities and tame the elements of nature. Some travelers choose this place to find solitude, while the island's only settlement to the south, Windreach, is made up of fugitives, monks, wanderers, exiles, and even a few escapees from the demon-infested Olgizmar.

The tower itself is a unique landmark. The smooth black granite that juts out from the steep northern shores culminates in a huge pinnacle, full of holes and hollows, where falcons, albatross and other seabirds come and go. Many legends say that the tower of the falcon is the only place B'tolen chose to settle, and even then for a while. The winds here seem to never stop, carving strange shapes into the stone, and rumor has it that the Flight of the Falcon brought all these flocks of birds here.

Quite often, gatherings of druids, also known as Storm Swarms, take place in the falcon's tower. The right to participate in a Flock are those druids who have managed to come to the island without a boat or other vessel and have lived a year on the island, as well as the leader from the Falcons of Rondor, who can and does communicate in the language of nature. The Swarms decide on important matters to do with nature and preventing the expansion of civilization. The druids on the island have absolute authority, and often the young come here to apprentice under some old mentor. The Swarm is led by the Callist, who decides when its gatherings will take place.

Until recently, the Summoner of the Swarm was Raefibb, who decided to step down and leave the island permanently. The position is now empty, and gatherings are becoming more sparse than before. Although there are several candidates, the majority believe that it is better to wait for an ideal candidate than to produce someone who will not be able to meet all the requirements.
