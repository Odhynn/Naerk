Many characteristics of Warm make its existence "impossible" and even more mysteries revolve around it. In a very northern and cold region, its waters are permanently warm (hence its name). It has the shape of a coiling snake and at one point the waters are flowing upwards. It ends in a pit that is rumored to end up in the [[Water Quarter]] and it is not clear where it begins as water comes out of the ground in a swampy area of ​​the mountains (although probably underground currents are the explanation for this phenomenon many again they want the source to be the Water Quarter). The waters of the river are often disturbed without anyone being able to explain this. In the surrounding area there are various elementals of water, earth and air. Although it is formally disputed when and under what conditions Warm was created, most sources place it there since the time of [[Ashiro]] and want him to be its creator. In fact, there is no record of it in the older maps and this reinforces that theory.

One of the first, if not the first mage to go there to study it was [[Kemil]], a mage with tremendous powers and for many perhaps the best mage specializing in elemental magic. that settled in the area and got the interest of [[Ashiro's Legacy]].

The residence near Warm was called [[Kemilia]] and in its heyday it became a town with trade flourishing and strengthening even the surrounding areas. At the same time, kidnappings and sacrifices of non-elves began to be recorded and increased at an exponential rate. The government, however, did not dare to send an army to stop this situation as it estimated that the unrest that would be created by attacking an area "trade center" (and the possible suspension of exports from there as a sign of protest) would be far greater than those it had to deal with due to the disappearances and deaths.

Many controversial (mostly Legacy-friendly) sources record [[Chandor]], one of the first to openly take a stand against [[Ashiro's Legacy]], trying to stop this situation. The result of this move was that he was face to face with Kemil and barely managed to escape with his life. They even say that the waters of the Warm have been warm since [[Chandor]] touched them in that battle, and that the river's upheavals occur whenever he is in the area.
