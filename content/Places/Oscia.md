## Origin

The city was named after the [[Empress Oscia I]] Neruso by her brother, [[Emperor Ralos I]], after her tragic death. It quickly became a major port and trading center, especially after the [[First Zelgerosh Exploration]] and the establishment of the South Trade Route and was named Second Capital of [[Imtaria]].

## History

The merchant lords of Oscia secretly contracted the [[Crimson Steel]] during the early days of the reign of the Ragas dynasty to take out [[Emperor Nillengar I]], as they wanted to increase the influence of the [[South Sea]] to the throne and decrease the influence of [[Syvorms]]' power center. To this day, a constant power game takes place about which region is favored the most by the emperor: Southeast or Northeast [[Imtaria]]. This includes lower taxes, more army garrisons and priority to infrastructure and development. After one succesful and one failed assassination attempt, they were hunted down by [[Emperor Karys I]] and caught eventually in [[Whistor]] by the fleet. Three of them were publicly tortured for a week and executed in Oscia while two more met an even worse fate in [[Vaedar]]. After these events, Oscia lost the title of Second Capital.
