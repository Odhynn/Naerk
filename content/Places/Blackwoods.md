A huge forest of blackened trees that was created from the spectral remnants of [[Ghost War]]. When the War ended and the spirits, plants and fey returned to [[Evergrowing Forest]], they left these skeletal trees behind, after the first spring and the reincarnation of [[Malahir]]. Blackwoods contains the echoes of ghosts, roaming spirits, and is haunted in most places. The creatures there are malformed and only few daring travellers cross these dark trees. The place bears the marks of the Ghost War everywhere. Among the withered trees are in many places the skeletons of huge animals and the remains of ghosts. Whole rocks are found cut with surgical precision, while even the trees' lament can be heard in the wind.

This forest lies to the south of [[Oventhart]] and form a natural border between the cities and farms of the North and the [[Allwick]] Wilderness. Very few creatures dare to visit these woods. The stories that have spread out are pretty gruesome, and passers-by usually confirm them. The creatures left here are either unnatural, aggressive spirits that prey on any potential victim, or animal hybrids and plants monsters, which may not be hostile to travelers, but they certainly prefer their peace, at best. From centaur tribes with bows and arrows, to playful satyrs, and from trap plants to poisonous mushrooms and giant wasps, these forests bear very little resemblance to the average temperate forest.

The truth is that if there were no trade, no one would pass through the forest, and such ominous reports would be rare. However, the nomads of Allwick, as they wanted to trade with the people of Oventhart, find that the forest route is a necessary evil. During the [[War of Karahath]], many refugees went to the southern deserts, while the two countries trades exchanged from the south for steel from the north. Therefore, for all these reasons, powerful druids and trackers were recruited, who were given the task of keeping the forest path open and accessible to travelers and caravans, in exchange for being able to exercise authority over the entire forest and be supplied with the necessary goods from the passing caravans. The instances where [[Ghostwatch]] have saved caravans from ghost attacks are countless.

Thus the road was named Vinepass, and the guard [[Ghostwatch]]. Their leader is [[Chandor]] the Stranger, while in his absence an elf named [[Aeluril]], considered Oventhart's third best archer, is in charge. To the north of the Vinepass, there is also a tavern called Winewisps, where all the caravans and Ghostwatch stop and exchange stories. On a rare occasion, there is a small chance that the tavern will also be visited by some of the more sociable creatures of the forest, mainly Satyrs, who exchange their stories with brave treats of alcohol from the travelers.
