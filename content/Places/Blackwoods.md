A huge forest of blackened trees that was created from the spectral remnants of [[Ghost War]]. When the War ended and the spirits, plants and fey returned to [[Evergrowing Forest]], they left these skeletal trees behind, after the first spring and the reincarnation of [[Malahir]]. Blackwoods contains the echoes of ghosts, roaming spirits, and is haunted in most places. The creatures there are malformed and only few daring travellers cross these dark trees.
