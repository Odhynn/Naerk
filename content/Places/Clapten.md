## The greedy scalpers

The town of Clapten is one of the coldest in the North. However, it is by no means the northernmost. Several towns in [[Korhond]] and in the east are in higher latitude, and certainly the temperature is very low there too. What set Clapten apart, however, was the air. An icy northwest wind blows permanently through the city, bringing waves that crash wildly onto the battered shores. And the few times it doesn't blow, it has a cursed humidity from the sea that freezes the houses and afflicts the inhabitants with colds and pneumonia.

An innocent observer could easily conclude that Clapten should never have become a town. This had to remain a small village as it was a few centuries ago, with a few hundred families of hardy fishermen and everyone else moving elsewhere. However, everything changed with trade. In the south, trade flourished and an array of goods that were hard to find were abundant in the Wild Sea of Belgosreim. These were the furs of the seal, the blubber of the whale, the walrus tusks and the horns of the unicorns. Demand was high and many opportunistic traders moved north to Clapten to seek their fortune.

Clapten is a town built quickly, without any rural plan, and this is obvious to any visitor. The port has a huge area, so that it can accommodate all merchant ships, whaling and fishing boats. Every inhabitant, fisherman or merchant, tried to build his house in a rough way, as close as possible to his wharf in the port. The result is that apart from the main port, there are five more above, with the houses built scattered. Many areas are literally on top of each other, while those in between are completely uninhabited. As a city it is not fortified, while it is governed by a council of merchants.

Moreover, the city is infamous for good relations with its neighbors. Most of the inhabitants are taciturn, selfish and greedy, as all they care about is money. Usually of course, even for the few who get rich, they realize that it was in vain as they have become ill from the bad climate of the area and have to move elsewhere to spend their wealth, since the place is not intended for a comfortable and peaceful life. Neighboring tribes believe Clapten should not exist in the North. Most northerners respect nature and have much higher ideals than money, so they have a strong prejudice against the "greedy scalpers", as they call the inhabitants of Clapten.

## Raiding and plunder

Thus Clapten has been raided by the harshest tribes of the north. The [[Vagor|Razortusk]] orcs that dwell in the north are forever keen to wipe the city off the map. In the first two raids, the inhabitants met them with storms of arrows that drove them to flee, but in the third, four years later, in the year 4740, the orcs were able to invade the city and began to plunder it. But the natives had loaded their ships with provisions and whatever valuable there was, and as soon as the defense was broken most of them boarded there and waited for the orcs to depart.

What few know is that the orcs alone could not break the city's defenses. They had help from the [[Twilight Veil]], a group of elven wizards and witches who saw Clapten as a miasma in the North and aided the orcs in battle. However, they did not appear in person, contenting themselves with empowering the warriors with protective spells and creating mist to hide them.

Clapten has now been rebuilt, but it is only a matter of time before it is raided again.
