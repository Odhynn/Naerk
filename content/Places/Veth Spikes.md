## Formation

These spikes formed when a crystalline formation from [[Veth]] fell upon [[Naerk]]. These crystals are located in the southeast of the [[Allwick]] Desert, while many believe that this was one of the reasons for the desertification of the area. Upon impact, the radiation's effect on Naerk was amplified. Gradually very powerful magicians and supernatural beings and magical effects appeared, some of which rivaled the power of gods.

## History

Maeronian servants gathered in the region and began to create unique magical effects: stories say that at that time, flying cities, endless food and drink, teleported armies, swarms of magical creatures, age-old wizards, and many other magical effects of similar scope appeared in this place. It was there that the Vethfolk first appeared, humanoids directly influenced by the chaotic magic of the [[Zinctizuctra]]. Things looked good for the locals, while a city was created, called [[Xe'Farom]] was thriving and ever-growing, promising ever-better living conditions for its inhabitants. It attracted a huge crowd of a wide range of magic users and soon began to expand, while at a moment's notice, it began to flourish.

That was until -1039, where on a rare [[Astral Alignment]] [[Maeronian]] drew immense arcane power in the area. The amplified magic area was exploited by many spellcasters, that started teleporting at-will and creating time and space gaps with their spells.
