## History

In the previous century, a small group operated in [[South Darrok]] in the service of [[King Hawlfeyth]]. The area they were operating in was in the eastern swamps of Zunomar, specifically in the capital of the region, Khalaram. Also known as The [[Khalarsnake]], they received orders directly from the King, and carried them out without contradiction. Hated by some, trusted by others, they were among the most popular people in the country.

Apparently, despite its uniqueness, Khalaram remained a South Darrok city. Therefore, he had certain obligations: To send his taxes, to send an army whenever necessary, and to avoid conflict with his neighboring administrative districts. Within a year, it failed all three. The tax collectors returned empty-handed, and with promises of future payments with interest. The Dumspergrond titan invasion found the area coldly indifferent. And even worse, early the next year hordes of zombies attacked villages near Lamerpad: An act for which all Khalaram authorities disclaimed any responsibility.
 

And while the knot reached the comb, in Khalaram things had cleared up. Those left of the old guard were servants and puppets in [[Zeith Gyr|Zeith]]'s service. Those who resisted were punished exemplarily by [[Khalar Gyr|Nyrda]], [[Hurdali Khamarnaya|Hurdali]], or [[Matthen Bluntnose|Matthen]], while [[Khalar Gyr|Khalar]] and [[Horionvill]] made sure to learn all the rumors, and keep all mages under their control. Soon the entire city was operating under the absolute authority of the [[Khalarsnake]].

## Independence

The now new King Labelas Lionhead could not leave this situation unanswered. In the spring of 4779, the general [[Ildish]] Tetharym appeared outside the city walls with two thousand warriors and demanded the surrender of Zeith. Apparently, no one was caught off guard: Horionvill knew how many soldiers she would bring before she even set off from [[Ekteron]]. The gates opened, but only zombies came out to greet the army. [[Ildish]] dealt with them without much effort, but realized that there was now no bridge of communication with Khalaram.

Their losses were light as the army was well equipped and experienced and [[Ildish]] a very powerful mage and warrior. They decided to lay siege to the city, but storming the walls found many magical traps and archers shooting arrows. The general shouted retreat until siege weapons were ready. They set up tents to camp around the walls. Their food, however, turned out to be poisoned: Hurdali gave Nyrda a powerful poison that she was able to pour into several cauldrons without them noticing. Vomiting and diarrhea caught almost half of the warriors.
 
In the middle of the night, however, the Khalarsnakes struck again. Vampires appeared in many tents and drained the blood of several warriors, while the undead and the vampires themselves rose like zombies from Horionvill. The battle this time was much more difficult. Ildish himself was forced to resort to his strongest spells to burn most of the vampires, and when he ran out of them, he began hacking them to pieces with his silver sword. In his attempt to reach Horionvill, he was confronted by Matthen, who delayed him long enough for them both to teleport safely away. The battle dragged on for most of the night, and by morning the undead were all dead for good, albeit with unacceptably heavy losses for the South Darrok's army.
 
Although they repulsed the attack, Ildish knew the cause was lost. The city had chosen its own path. The only way they could reclaim it now would be with their entire army, and even then they would suffer significant losses. He returned to Ekteron to explain this to [[King Labelas Lionhead|Labelas]], who agreed that they did not have the resources to attack at such a difficult time. Khalaram had proven that it wanted no one over its head: and just like that, this city has left the jurisdiction of south Darrok and is now going its own way.
