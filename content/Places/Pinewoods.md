A big forest of pine trees in [[Tarthyn]] that borders [[Green Hills]]. It hosts several wild beasts, including fierce dire badgers.

## Tarthyn Invasion

After the fall of [[Silkwin]] to the armies of [[Kenorex]], many groups of refugees sought refuge in the woods, to the dismay of many druids. In the northern part of the forest two new settlements were formed to host their arrival.
