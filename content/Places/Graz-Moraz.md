Graz-Moraz was a city where elves and dwarves lived harmoniously and peacefully. They were trying to build a huge tower with 12 floors: 6 for the Dwarven gods and 6 for the Elven gods as a dedication. The tower, however, was never completed and was constantly falling down. But then a high priest of the Great Mother Sect of [[Drakainia]] appeared, who promised to help them if they would let him build a thirteenth floor with a bell. The tower was magically built in a day, and the bell, which belonged to [[Ireno]], began to ring of its own accord. Toxic rain and fog appeared out of nowhere, and fields began to be destroyed. Soon, a civil war started from fights between dwarves and elves, while mutations gradually appeared on them. Soon, the city was completely dissolved and [[Drakainia]] sucked the life force out of all the inhabitants. Then she understood that if she repeated it with more people she would be able to free herself completely from her prison.

After millennia, a group of believers finally were able to communicate with her. The church of St. Traft was founded, and they re-established the Sect of the Great Mother at [[Merkal]], which was nearby. They found the bell in the ruins of Graz-Moraz and attached it to their church, Merkal, and began their ceremony, where the first ring practically enabled Drakainia to summon her army again for the first time in millennia upon [[Naerk]].


The story regarding the great bell is found on [[Ireno's Bell]]'s chronicle.
