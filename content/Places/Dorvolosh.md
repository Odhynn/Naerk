The capital of northern [[Olgizmar]] that is governed by [[Demonslaver]] circles. They have managed to keep the demons at bay from the area after ther rebellion with powerful wards. The city now is home to numerous thugs, assassins, black market vendors, beggars and many villagers that seek protection from demon attacks. The streets are dangerous and burglars lurk in most corners, avoiding only the pockets of the wizards or demons. The town still contains temples of the [[Demon Archlords]] and many townsfolk, primarily drow and tieflings, find shelter in praying there.
