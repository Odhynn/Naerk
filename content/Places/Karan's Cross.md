A small fertile island in northwest [[Stormfall]].

## History

This was the refuge of the [[Alagon]] pirates after their defeat at [[Stormfall Defence]]. However, it could not sustain everyone who had come there. Thus, two hundred pirates remained, while all the rest left in ships, drawing lots. Of their 45 ships, only 12 made it to Alagon, and rumor has it that many of the survivors had stolen food from other ships to survive or had cannibalized corpses. Since then, pirates have not sent another expedition to Stormsfall, but the colony at Karan's Cross has been maintained, and exiled or condemned pirates have often been sent there.
