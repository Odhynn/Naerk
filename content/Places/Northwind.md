A small village full of farms and windmills that was destroyed by fomorians led by [[Krellantre]] during the [[War of the Titan]]. Many villagers were tortured and slain in many cruel ways and only half managed to run away and seek refuge in [[Ekteron]]. It was later rebuilt and the refuges returned.
