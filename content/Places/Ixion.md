After the [[Pinewoods Slaughter]], [[Otynhash]], the god of power came to a painful conclusion. Of those who had survived the battle, the vast majority belonged to the first generations to whom he had given his gift. Somehow, Otynhash realized that not everyone was worthy of such a blessing. Anyone who wanted his help would first have to prove himself worthy of it. So he set in [[Pinewoods]] a challenge he felt was fitting.

He built a labyrinth at the entrance to one of his temples, which stretched for miles through a muddy and wooded region, and named it Ixion. In there, no magic works at all: Only by conventional means can one face the challenges that lie ahead. And when it comes to challenges, Otynhash gave his worst. In there there are stories of deformed plants, wild animals and beasts, huge demons and minotaurs.

The further one gets in the maze, the bigger the challenge. Anyone who reaches certain altars in the maze gains the gift of Otynhash, a simple blessing usually linked to his choices in the maze, the creatures he fought, and his temperament. He is safe to return: if he chooses to stay still the next altars become even more demanding and the path much more dangerous, but the reward is greater still.

For the vast majority, death lurks around every corner. Many travelers and druids have been lost there unknowingly, never to emerge, and those who emerged were unrecognizable. In the past, [[Raefibb]] had attempted with several Swarm [[Druids]] to destroy the labyrinth, but their efforts met with little success and heavy casualties.

There is a rare category of those who manage to reach the first altars and choose to continue. The vast majority face dangers beyond imagination. There are, however, some rare cases of those who passed the entire labyrinth and reached the end, the final altar. These are the Chosen of Otynhash, and they are less than a dozen. For them the demon god saves his greatest gifts. They often become generals of demonic hordes, warriors of unparalleled strength and endurance. Even the sight of them often strikes terror into many armies.
