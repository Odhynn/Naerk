A huge fortress with towering steel walls deep in the heart of [[Tarhelm]]. It was made by [[Rhekvethor]] with the [[Rod of Stone and Steel]]. It contains a massive garrison and forge, filled with many kinds of weapons and able to withstand any siege. In the foundations lies a puzzling labyrinth that is said to connect to the [[Deeps]] and is guarded by huge mithral constructs.

## History

The fortress was inhabited in secret by the titan [[Dumspergrond]]. After the [[War of the Titan]], it was captured by dwarves after they negociated with the giants guarding for their safe escort in the mountains. Since then, it has become a thriving dwarven and stonefolk settlement that also marks the gateway to [[Northern Darrok]].
