A Lizardfolk city with a vast [[Deeps]] network of passages.

## History

Originally, the port was an administrative center of [[Whistor]] navy. The competent authorities and the Duchy however realized how exposed Carlitta was to piracy and built another port in the south of the island, protected and fortified with high walls. At the same time, the Southern Trade Route was shifted to the open sea, and ceased to pass through Carlitta for a long time, while merchants approached the island at their own risk. The reinforcement of Whistor's fleet, however, acted effectively to expel would-be pirates, and for a time the situation on the island normalized.

After many supply problems, the remaining locals were forced to expand into the nearby Darvass Swamps and Baracos Jungles. However, the local indigenous populations of lizardfolk, toadfolk, and other swamp creatures fought back. With a coordinated attack, in which they even had dinosaurs, they attacked Carlitta, which violently passed into their own control after its final destruction.
