This city, once (and still, in some ways) a very convenient port for [[Oventhart]], about six months before [[Seriatul]] came to inhabit the bay was attacked by kobolds and evacuated by the elves who lived there. By the time Oventhart sent an army to retake it, Seriatul had already settled there and was now protected by the [[Dragonpact]] (many say that Seriatul organized the attack himself to settle under the protection of the Dragonpact and many others say that he simply took advantage of the situation )

This was one of the events that strengthened [[Ashiro's Legacy]], as Ralzyn was a city mostly inhabited by elves. As for the current state of Ralzyn, it is a city wonderfully preserved with nice picturesque squares, wonderful beaches and much more. Access to it is allowed if your pocket can afford it and it is a destination that brings people from far and wide. It is fully functional from the kobolds, with three hotels, five taverns/restaurants and more. It is used by Oventhart as a trading port to supply as long as this in turn gives it the appropriate exchange, as it is also used by individual merchants (or groups of merchants) for the same reason again with the appropriate exchange.
