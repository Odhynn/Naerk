## Creation

Made entirely of crystals and ice, this fortress is permanently frozen and has been abandoned at times. It was created three millennia ago and is believed to have been made by renegade [[Twilight Veil]], including the one responsible for the [[Bladdar Massacre]], [[Ylamir]] and his undead army from the battlefield. It was a tribute to the goddess: A castle in her name. All the undead went to work without interruption, and Ylamir used his spells to perfect their work. Stones, ices, crystals, topazes and emeralds were its basic materials. Arches and columns to enormous heights gradually formed, while some crystals were made of Almefis' spells.

It took a full decade to complete, but in the end [[Ylamir]] was satisfied with the result. He retired to his chambers with [[Almefis]], and named the palace Fol'rish, the White Wonder. It was then that Rusalka exacted the sorcerer's final debt: After taking his seed, she killed him and took his heart for [[Fallfaunt]]. He placed it in the center of the palace, and it began to glow with a blue light, as the heart had now become a mighty artifact with immense power. And Almefis became the castellan of Fol'rish, with the undead serving her, while nothing was ever learned about her child: though many believe she is the witch who started the [[Winter's War]].
