An orcish whaler port.

## History

A wild town, Thoromeil was originally a settlement of settlers from [[Walgri Isles]]. The stories say that they came here after the eruption of [[Haza Vulca]] in the year 3837, as in addition to the destruction of their land, many were driven out by the firefolk who came at that time. The settlement they founded soon flourished as there was an abundance of fishing in the southern bay. Whaling was especially developed as the area was a whale birthing point. Every year in the first week of Snowmelt, the whales of [[Thimvert]] came here and gave birth to their young: huge and formidable beasts, reaching ninety feet long and two hundred thousand pounds.

The natives had built long canoes and in these they hunted the whales with harpoons. They praised [[Jalerk]] for her gifts and gradually their population grew. Their prosperity, however, did not go unnoticed by the nearby Broken Skull orc tribe (a historical offshoot of the [[Dal'Vorag]] tribe of the North). Their raids initially plundered the settlement's supply of whale oil, fat, meat and bones, as it was easy for them to do the fishing for the natives and then steal the processed products.

Although a peaceful people, the natives took up arms to defend themselves from the orcs. The battle took place in the year 3849 in the southern gorges of Fez-Moyer. The orcs had been informed by scouts that the natives were waiting for them, and they mobilized all their warriors. They descended three times as many and much better armed, and massacred the natives' lines. They entered the village, burned it and plundered it to the last house. Nothing remained of the old settlement, and it is said that no one survived this massacre.

The orcs gave the settlement its current name, Thoromeil, and continued whaling. A few centuries later it had developed into a city and people from other parts of Whistor had come to live there. It was incorporated into [[Whistor]] on favorable terms and reduced taxation, and in return the merchants of [[Sjemhe]] and [[Vhit√∫]] supplied the isolated region with iron, raw materials, spices and everything necessary to develop whaling. Gradually, Thoromeil began to export increasingly large quantities of whale products, and the once warlike orcs were integrated into Whistor's commercial activities.

However, the age of piracy found Thoromeil in uncertain alliances. There were many whalers who supported the pirates in their activities and came into immediate conflict with Whistor. But when the pirates reached the point of attacking and robbing whaling ships, the townspeople stopped their dealings with them and expelled those who had any connection with them. The orcs once again took up arms against the pirates and many of them volunteered to join Whistor's regular army. Pirates eventually settled in the eastern part of the city, that was named Shadow Edge and was populated by numerous undead and shadowfolk.
