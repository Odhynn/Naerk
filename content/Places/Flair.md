The city on the opposite side of [[Serpent's Tail]] from [[Sapurr]], is a major merchant stop for the country. It is connected with Sapurr by a huge bridge, that is said to have been made by cyclops from old [[Rogvad]], or to have been made with the [[Rod of Stone and Steel]]: The secret of its creation is lost in ancient times. It is four miles long, consists of huge stone arches and connects the two towns.
