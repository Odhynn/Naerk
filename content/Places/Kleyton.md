## Description

The city is a huge commercial center, which is one of the largest cities in all of Na'erk. Most ships from [[Imtaria]] to [[Whistor]] or [[Zelgerosh]] stop here for supplies and trade. For centuries now, the local authority collected a small tax from every ship that stopped, which they invested in the Arcane Academy, also known as [[Azarak]], and the Bridge of Dreams.

Kleyton is governed by a co-ed council of 21 members. Of these, 6 are merchants, guild leaders, and aristocrats, 3 are shipwrights with a large fleet, four are priests of [[Sumril]], [[Sennek]], [[Yushan]] and [[Maeronian]] while the remaining 8 are wizards, of which 7 are [[Cornuzel]]. Decisions are taken by a simple majority, but for the most critical there must be an absolute one, i.e. 11 people. The decisions of the council are strictly respected, and there are enough guards and golems to ensure that they are followed.

Kleyton is capital of the narrow [[Reisdok]], but differs vastly from the rest of the region. In addition to the many natives, who are at best prejudiced against the urban people, there are also many lairs of kobolds, who even use trained dinosaurs to raid and pillage the countryside. These warbands are organized by various local tribes, as well as priests of [[Sseratush]], who want to permanently eradicate the "Kleyton Contamination", as they call it, from the area.

## History

After many unsuccesful attempts centuries ago, the native warbands have given up trying to attack the city. In the last two centuries it has suffered four attacks by bog monsters and two by pirates. Its towering walls are reinforced with magic, while at the same time magical traps and protective runes ward many places. Its guard is experienced though, and the dangers it now faces seem very small.
