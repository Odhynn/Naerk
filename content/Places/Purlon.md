The once-proud city of the [[Demonslavers]], with a summoning tower where rituals to call [[demons]] from the [[Abyss]] took place. These rituals eventually got out of control, and a permanent [[Portal]] was opened to the [[Abyss]], that the demons used to invade the [[Material Plane]] in numbers. The corruption of the Abyss spread out and most of the city was destroyed and its citizens and wizards slaughtered.

It was inhabited anew by the demons and their allies under the leadership of the archdemons of the [[Vile Septet]].
