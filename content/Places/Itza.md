A tribal [[Tixali]] city with huge columns dedicated to [[Aspects]], a work of the architect [[Nalgarone]].

During the [[First Zelgerosh Exploration]], the natives were initially aggresive to the explorers of [[Imtaria]], but with the intervention of [[Ravyn]] and [[Nalgarone]], the hostilities stopped and they agreed with the local lizardfolk to exchange metals and tools for precious stones and forest fruits. Nalgarone then began to show them various architectural and mechanical skills that he knew, which made the [[Tixali]] respect and trust him. Nalgarone later used this for his own purposes, but at first he built them incredible buildings and temples, unique in style and dimensions, while also fitting in with the customs and traditions of the region. Thus, the architect settled there.
