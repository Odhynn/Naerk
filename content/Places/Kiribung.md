A disputed lake at northern [[Fervolosh]] forest.

## History

Lake Kiribung, north of Fervolosh, traditionally belonged to the [[Volnoch]] (Underpine) tribe. It was outside of the border with the [[Daral]] (Fir) who owned the forests to the west, but very close to the border with the [[Skra]] (Steady Hand). So when in the spring of 4818 Volnoch's fishermen saw Skra soldiers on the opposite bank, they knew their claim was not so sure. A small group went to speak to them, but were met with arrows and threats. That was enough reason for Volnoch to start a war, resulting in the [[First Battle of Kiribung]] and [[Second Battle of Kiribung]].

In the aftermath of those bloody battles, the southern side of the lake passed permanently to the [[Skra]], while the [[Volnoch]] mourned their losses. They also accused the [[Daral]] of letting such an expeditionary force pass through their territory unmolested, and of being complicit. The Daral retorted that they had warned the Skra not to advance, and that they were unprepared to face the passing army. Be that as it may, this led to rearrangements in all three clans. Elder Shaman [[Kaldran]] became more paranoid than ever with the death of his son. Raka started border skirmishes and skirmishes with the Skra, while Meegar gained even more power in the Skra, to the dismay of many. At the same time, several of the Daral border guards were fingered for their inaction. The situation in the three tribes remained unstable.
