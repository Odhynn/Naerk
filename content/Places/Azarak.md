A massive building with two towers over a thousand feet high, and the famous Bridge of Dreams, which connects the two sides of the [[River Dolk]]. Numerous wizards come from all [[Naerk]] to study magic here. In this place the wizards of [[Cornuzel]] formed and defined some of the very basic tenets of the magic of [[Veth]] that are still followed today by most practicioners. Overtime, the building has expanded with numerous portals, moving bridges and towers that host powerful spellcasters and outsiders. The sight of it alone is usually enough to deter any pirate or native from attacking the city, and its top can be seen as far as [[Ansivaal]]. Its bridge is in the seven colors of the rainbow and its architecture defies gravity in many places.
