A massive building with two towers over a thousand feet high, and the famous Bridge of Dreams, which connects the two sides of the [[River Dolk]]. Numerous wizards come from all [[Naerk]] to study magic here. In this place the wizards of [[Cornuzel]] formed and defined some of the very basic tenets of the magic of [[Veth]] that are still followed today by most practicioners. Overtime, the building has expanded with numerous portals, moving bridges and towers that host powerful spellcasters and outsiders.
