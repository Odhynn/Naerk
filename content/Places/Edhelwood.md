A huge forest, one of the largest in [[Naerk]]. It wass originally the ancestral home of the elven civilization of the [[Edhellin]]. After their fall, it was occupied for two centuries by orcs and humans of [[Rammok Wastes]] and [[Tithlon]], until the elves rallied and reclaimed their home, establishing the region of [[Naryal]].
