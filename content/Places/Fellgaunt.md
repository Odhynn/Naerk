Fellgaunt is one of the most popular stops for caravans and traders in Oromil. It is the only city in a large radius in the vast plains of the region. Simultaneously, it has infinite wells, which do not run dry even in times of drought. It has a reputation that whatever one is looking for, he can find it there. Fellgaunt represents a natural border on [[Imtaria]]'s influence, for most of the locals never liked them, while at the same time Imtaria found dealing with Fellgaunt a waste of people and resources.

Four main families ruled the city, who were in constant rivalry. These were Tulenkar, Merydra, Meacel and Kalistrom. All of them had financial rivalries over who would rule the city, and the four-member senate was constantly at odds. That is, until the day [[Tarlosh Kalistrom]] became a senator. What was a common secret was that Tarlosh was a necromancer, and a very powerful one at that. The dispute began with whether the slave trade should be allowed in the city, with the Kalistroms arguing that it was a particularly profitable method, with the imposition of taxes, while they also had the support of the Merydra.

This eventually led to the [[Battle of Fellgaunt]], or more appropriately for Fellgaunt, that determined the winning family of Tulenkar and the losing family of Kalistrom. This is how the Tulenkar today rule the city. Their influence now extended throughout the country, and their trade guild was widely known. [[Gathclan Tulenkar]] became the defacto leader of the council. Peace returned to the city, although many of [[Karadosh]]'s followers continued to fight on the plains for a few years after this event, as the priest [[Voldrak]] gained power after the siege and began to lead the ranks of the [[Gheren Steed]] for several years thereafter.

The city is currently the capital of Oromil and ruled by [[Beyin]], the daughter of [[Gathclan Tulenkar]].
