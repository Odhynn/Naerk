A great elven city built during the peak of the [[Edhellin]] civilization, two millenia before the [[Ghost War]]. It was the capital of the [[Edhellin]] just before their fall, a marvelous city that was fortified to withstand the [[Edhelwood Invasion]]. It is one of the few places where half-elven orcs can be found.
