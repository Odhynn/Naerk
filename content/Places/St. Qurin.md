One of the first cities established in [[Zelgerosh]] by [[Imtaria]]n settlers in eastern [[Haltu Desert]] and on the north bank of [[Ayui River]]. It was named after the famous explorer [[Qurin]]. With access to water, scarce raw materials, and fertile enough land to support farms, Qurin quickly grew into a small city, with fortifications and a central trading post. This was the start of the Southern Trade Route that carried goods to and from [[Imtaria]] with stops at [[Whistor]] and [[Markesh]].

It is periodically attacked by pirate ships from [[Plunder Town]].
