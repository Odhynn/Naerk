The capital of [[Tarthyn]]. It hosts a great [[Reszek]] temple and a library of the [[Luminous Order]].

During the [[Tarthyn Invasion]], it was besieged by [[Kenorex]] but a lot of people were stranded outside the city walls as the gates closed. They were captured, tortured and executed. The siege equipment was ready that night, as many pieces simply had to be carried from the ships, as they were already assembled. The city was within range of the catapults from [[Kambah]]'s massive ships, and they soon began to fire missiles coated in fires from [[Hell]] itself. They exploded and burned everything, ignoring even the defenses from the priests of the [[Luminous Order]]. Some projectiles even released devils from within when they exploded, resembling flaming felines. These beasts fell upon the defenders and maimed scores of them before the priests and knights of the Order killed them or chased them back to Hell.

After a rampart spot was cleared of defenders by siegebreaker [[Nolgor]], it was filled with [[Kenorex]] warriors. After they established a foothold, they tried to advance to the first building block, but were greeted by a shower of arrows and divine fire and were forced to stop. But the outer wall had fallen, and the warriors began to gather there, taking cover from the surrounding towers. As night began to fall, hostilities ceased, but the Kenorex would not let the inhabitants rest and mourn their dead. Unearthly screams from hideous creatures broke the silence of the night, along with occasional catapult shots.

The next morning the [[Kambah]] army stopped the attacks. [[Rongerak]] and his entourage appeared in front of the South Gate of the main city with a white flag, ready for negotiations. Very quickly, Odern with his own entourage and [[Grok]] came down to meet him. Rongerak gave him two options, ignoring the murderous glares the king was giving him. Either he would surrender the city, and take his word that he would not continue on to the rest of Tarthyn, or he would grant him all the territory north of Lake [[Tartha]], the [[Pinewoods]] and west of [[Silkwin]]. In each case he pledged to release the captives and return the bodies of the dead, to ensure that the king would agree to negotiate.

Odern found it particularly difficult to answer. Rongerak gave him a day's notice, for he knew he was in danger of [[Green Hills]]' forces coming to their aid. Either he would lose nearly a fifth of his country, or the capital, which was a center of trade and industry, a strong defensive barrier, and seat of the crown. He asked his advisors, and with the exception of one druid and some lords who owned land to the west, most agreed that it was best to save the city. Odern with a heavy heart gave his answer to the Tyrrant, and the next day the siege ended and the captives returned to their families.

Thus, Silkwin was annexed to [[Kambah]] territory. Kenorex forces built a huge barracks and a cathedral of [[Sergonial]] was raised in the place of the [[Reszek]] temple.
