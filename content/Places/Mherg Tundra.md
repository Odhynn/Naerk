The tundra that spreads beyond [[Hoen]] and [[Oventhart]] to the freezing wastes.

## Vethfall

During [[Vethfall]], a huge extradimensional portal opened to the northwest of [[Oventhart]], in [[Mherg Tundra]]. It was at this point that Huge creatures from the [[Void]] Plane began to appear and head towards [[Merkal]] in waves, tearing apart everything in their path.

It soon became clear that the defense could not hold out forever. Each successive wave came stronger, with huge creatures with infinite eyes, tentacles and mental attacks. The defense was gradually giving way, and it became clear that the only way was for someone to go to the gate they were coming from and close it. And this job was undertaken by the [[Halcyon]], with the help of a few trusted friends and [[Twilight Veil]] that were aware of the events.

Ultimatelly, the destruction of Drakainia and the simultaneous collapse of the demiplane, combined with the destruction of one of Vivec's creations released a massive amount of magical energy. A huge crater was created in the [[Mherg Tundra]]. The only outlet for this energy was the [[Material Plane]], and a huge cataclysmic disaster could be caused. But that day he had a full moon of [[Veth]], who absorbed all the magic drained of the demiplane destruction by an energy beam that hit him. This energy infused Veth's corpse with life force, and it began to shake and churn.

A huge ripple effect of color was created, in the aurora borealis, that lasted for days and drastically changed how Veth's radiation, and by extension magic, worked. Teleportation magic was greatly weakened beyond short distances, and so was dimension-shifting magic. In the northern regions appeared areas where magic worked unpredictably and various unexplained magical phenomena appeared, as some [[Vethralls]] began to return to [[Material Plane]].
