## Origin

Among [[Yerastu]]'s few temples in Oromil, if not the only one, was the monastery of Ramsel, built in ancient times and for centuries guarding the northern borders of the vast valleys. The temple was manned by several dozen priests and warriors, while it was constantly supplied with food and munitions to withstand long sieges. One of the four [[Solarium Ring|rings]] of the [[Rod of Stone and Steel]] was even given to this temple for safekeeping in ancient times.

## Downfall

In time, however, the place where the temple was built, next to the Watchers, proved quite unsuitable. Most of the fighting and attacks in Oromil took place in the south rather than the north, while the [[Palaurim|treaty]] with [[Imtaria]] protected the area from attacks by nomads, orcs, or other wild tribes. At the same time, the [[Gheren Steed]]mercenaries in the west were taking on the main role of countering enemy attacks.

## The Cursed Monastery

Moreover, the priests themselves who lived there were indifferent to the fighting in the south, and believed that the location of the monastery was the most suitable. Slowly but surely they became isolated from the people of the valleys and their usefulness and supply began to be limited. Even worse, most were so fanatical that only two were able to denounce this isolationism and leave: [[Eberk]] and [[Scarlet]].

It wasn't long before disaster struck the place. Yerastu gradually stopped listening to his worshipers there and giving them spells, while they contented themselves with opening the gates to anyone who came for protection, in return. Soon another god began to answer their call, and he was none other than [[Voolthow]]. Seeing this, Yerastu cursed them to be trapped in the temple, but Voolthow offered to relieve them of the curse. In the end, the price was that they all became ghosts, undead in his service, and the place was tainted by Voolthow's influence.

## Restoration

The monastery was eventually reoccupied and restored in the fall of 4777, at the initiative of Eberk and the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]]. After a fierce battle, all the heretic undead were destroyed. Eberk was able to gather many followers of Yerastu, [[Sigard]] and [[Laerion]] to the temple, and soon created an order tasked with protecting northern Oromil at first, and later expanded to the whole country. The battalion was named [[Ironglance]]. However, the ring was not to stay in the temple for long, as it was stolen by [[Salkor|a thief]].
