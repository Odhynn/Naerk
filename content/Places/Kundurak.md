Kundurak, built by Cyclops, is the main reason trade in [[Vhuluriin Bay]] is so dangerous. The city possesses infinite small boats that can move quickly and mount armies of goblins on much larger ships, while their war engines are huge and throw alchemical fire, which burns ships at great distance.
