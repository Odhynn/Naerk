A superstructure of Dragonpact, erected with huge columns and arches made thousands of years ago and also includes the palace and residence of dragon [[Nentha]] himself. They are used for many discussions and councils of creatures in good spirit. They host a huge museum and library and all visitors upon entering take an oath to coexist peacefully within the space with others.
