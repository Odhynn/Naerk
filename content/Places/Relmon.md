A river city with flourishing trade and horse breeding.

During the [[Decade War of Arbader and South Darrok]] it was successfully protected, albeit with heavy casualties, under the command of lieutenant [[Mennis]] Lionhead. A giant stone statue looking south was erected to commemorate his deeds and bravery.
