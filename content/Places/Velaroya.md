Velaroya, also known as the end of the desert, or the ruby ​​of the east, is anything but a ruby. It is the largest port washed by the [[Agisor Sea]], and as it is on the border of [[Allwick]], [[Crol'gosh]] and [[Marelthia]], it is a crossroads of many civilizations. All sorts of races are found within it, but mostly humans, firefolk and windfolk. Within the city, goods were constantly being traded to and from the desert and the south, resulting in the creation of huge trade guilds that regulated the supply and demand of products.

But another unpredictable factor was about to gain interest in the city: the [[Pirate Council]]. The great value of the goods could not leave them unmoved. They took advantage of the city's loose garrison, and sent several spies to the merchant guilds, who sent information to corsairs to attack merchant ships. Within a year there had been dozens of attacks on ships and caravans, and the merchants were forced to turn to [[Blackclaw]] and hire orc mercenaries to guard the ships.

Obviously, the massive influx of orcs into the city was by no means a stabilizing factor. For each one that came, the incidents of violence grew far beyond what they were paid to deal with. Soon whole neighborhoods in the city were dealing with daily fights. Eventually even cultists of the [[Locust Blight]] arrived in town and began poisoning the water, attacking caravans arriving from [[Allwick]] and summoning insects.

Desperate, the trade guild lords turned to a small group of ronin, the [[Wolf Legion]], who had arrived traveling from the other side of [[Naerk]] on their ships. They were hired to partially restore order in the city, and had some success: But, given their small numbers, it was impossible to extend this to the whole area. Velaroya still presents endless opportunities for profit, but just as many for trouble.
