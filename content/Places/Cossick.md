The antagonists of [[Karahath]] had opened a Gate to the east of [[Zaelvosh]]'s forest and called some of his strongest servants, among them [[Lovarnian]], a half-fiend tormentor who everyone trembled in his presence. He built a fortress there, [[Cossick]], in which he began torturing people and trading the information he learned. Cossick was built upon a village of elves that lived there, and hardly any elves survived the torture of being captured after an unequal battle.
