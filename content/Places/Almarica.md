## Establishment

These were the words of Archbishop [[Felippe]] Sandiaz, when in the spring of the year 4478 he journeyed to the desert of [[On-Herja]], in southeast [[Whistor]]. A few pilgrims followed him, followers of [[Sigard]]. Half of them were foreigners, coming from [[Imtaria]] and [[Oromil]]. No one took him seriously at first. They thought he had simply gone mad from some vision of his god and drove the priesthood to a futile cause.

In an oasis, which had wells of water, Felippe built a church. There he began to preach his faith daily. He spoke of peace, harmony, and honor, concepts that have been almost forgotten in the land. Pirates had ravaged the countryside, and bandits the cities. Anyone who did not cooperate with them was in danger, and the country was practically ruled by a few corsairs who supported the king while he turned a blind eye to their crimes.

The priests of Sigard had opposed this from the first moment. But, as their faith prevented them from fighting, they often ended up victims of the destructive fury of the bandits. Many say that Felippe chose isolation to save the priesthood of [[Vhitú]], others that he simply wanted to save himself.

## City

Whatever the reason, what began as a pilgrimage of hermits soon ended up as a permanent settlement. More and more believers sought refuge there, first from [[Vhitú]] and eventually from the whole country. Clergy and flock found refuge there under Felippe's guidance and the area was built and grew. Gardens were filled with exotic plants and the water from the wells rose and passed through canals to all the houses. Gradually, the area grew and reached the dimensions of a city. And the name given to it was Almarica, the flower of the desert.

The migration to Almarica took place at a time when violence had multiplied in the country. But beyond its religious character, the city was also a refuge for any peasant seeking salvation. And none of those who entered dared challenge the authority of [[Felippe]] and the followers of [[Sigard]]. In this way, their religious power gradually turned into politics, and within three years, as the city continued to grow, it practically constituted the co-capital of the country. Walls protected it and soon priests from [[Sumril]] and [[Hansa]] also sought refuge there, with Felippe receiving them warmly.

## 700 Days of Shadow

Not long after, the tragic events of the [[700 Days of Shadow]] in [[Whistor]] took place. The creatures of darkness also attacked [[Almarica]], but the priests kept the darkness away from the city. In Almarica the first Holy Convocation took place in the year 4483. This Convocation, also known as the First Convocation of the Triad of Almarica, took on a permanent character and was called [[Divinalis]]. The clerics of the city played a crucial role in battling the undead threat.
