A once-peaceful river that crosses the middle part of the [[Arbader]] region, deriving from [[Ennis Mountains]] and pours unto the [[Urdankh]] sea. When gold was found in the river, a huge industry developed to its shores, creating dams and barriers to harvest the precious material. Eventually, the river started flooding most autumns.
