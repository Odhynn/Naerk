The oldest city of the Flame Gulf and Seat of the Sultan in [[Markesh]]. Hoarinhel is characterized by imposing curved buildings, gold and bronze decoration, decorative plaques with calligraphy, as well as a large merchant fleet. The wealth of the city is inexhaustible, while at the same time it possesses a particularly powerful mage guild. The city  maintains trade relationships with the Fire Giants from [[Ral'Zoton]]. At the city's harbor, the first [[Lan'Tui]] Fire Giants who immigrated here in the year 3574 built a massive statue of gold, copper, and bronze in honor of their first king. The statue reaches a height of three hundred and fifty feet, and on two occasions in the past it came to life and protected the city when it was in danger.


When [[Erstal]], a neighboring city began to accumulate power, after the [[Palaurim]] treaty, the Sultan of [[Hoarinhel]] acted immediately, resulting on the [[Siege of Erstal]]. He then forced the [[First Battle of Flame Gulf]], [[Second Battle of Flame Gulf]], [[Third Battle of Flame Gulf]] and [[Fourth Battle of Flame Gulf]] as a response to [[Dzultar]]'s growth and refusal to pay taxes. The hostilities eventually ended after a treaty was signed by all sides in [[Floweroot]] that forced all new cities to pay one-eigth the value of trading goods to the Sultan.
