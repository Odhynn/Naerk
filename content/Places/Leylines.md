These concentrations of magic are webbed across all over [[Naerk]] and fuel the world with magic even in the most remote places in the [[Deeps]]. They converge in places like stone menhirs or ancient trees. The power of these lines is measured by spellcasters in nodes, and in these intersections is where the spells are most powerful. These locations are usually guarded or hidden, and sometimes they are used for powerful rituals.
