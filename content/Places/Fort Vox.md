The final and most promising creation of the architect [[Nalgarone]], a fortified stone town with many secrets. He used a system of arches and wicker bridges at the entrances, and built it on a series of secluded rocks that made it practically impregnable, and was able to ensure that he had his own means of circulation and secret passages. [[Qurin]] appointed him the leader of Vox, as he trusted him.

Not long after, the locals blamed [[Nalgarone]] that he betrayed them, as he made most of the town areas inaccesible to them and filled it with curses, constructs and traps that responded only to his servants. He also became unfriendly to [[Qurin]] and decided to isolate himself.
