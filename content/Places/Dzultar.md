A few years later after the [[Siege of Erstal]], in 3976, Dzultar appeared in the spotlight. The city was the attempt by the most peaceful nomads of the north to reinforce their trade relations with [[Imtaria]], and as they were closer, many traders and guilds began to prefer it from [[Hoarinhel]]. The nomads had fur, salt, minerals and charcoal, and could very easily overthrow Hoarinhel's commercial monopoly controlled by the Sultan. His answer this time was mitigated: he demanded taxes equal to one quarter of the value of the trading goods, otherwise he would carry out an embargo.

In the first year the nomads accepted its term, but soon more and more began to question the taxes. The situation seemed impossible to solve peacefully. Neither side stepped back, so the Sultan sent fifty ships for embargo. Dzultar then attacked his army in the [[First Battle of Flame Gulf]] and the resulting [[Second Battle of Flame Gulf]], [[Third Battle of Flame Gulf]] and [[Fourth Battle of Flame Gulf]] with huge losses for the city.

The hostilities eventually ended after a treaty was signed by all sides in [[Floweroot]] that forced all new cities to pay one-eigth the value of trading goods to the Sultan.
