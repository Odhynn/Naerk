Serpent's Tail is a giant river that starts from northeast [[Tarhelm]] in [[North Darrok]] and splits the mountains in two in a giant gorge. There is a part where the river goes underground and is rumored to meet river [[Styx]]. Afterwards, it continues southwest, in a part that is also called Serpent's Head and pours into [[Roflar Gulf]] at [[South Darrok]]. The river was originally formed in a huge gap created by the [[Rod of Stone and Steel]].
