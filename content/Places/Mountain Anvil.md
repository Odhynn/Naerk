The ancient and proud city of Mountain Anvil, called Talhad in dwarven tongue, is one of the oldest dwarven settlements. Its origins are lost in the centuries when [[Klont]] made the first representatives of the dwarven species and they passed from [[Kelzadam]] into the [[Material Plane]]. This passage was made by digging, and it is said that in the depths of Talhad there still exist one of the first tunnels dug by the dwarves to come to inhabit [[Naerk]], though this is probably a closely guarded secret. The first king of the dwarves settled there and began to grow and build Talhad up to the surface. It was then that they first came into contact with the orcs and giants of [[Tarhelm]], which soon became a violent war of expansion as well as survival, as the other races soon became aware of the dwarves' riches. A few decades later, around the year -256, the dwarves came into contact with the humans who inhabited the fortress now called [[Kirrowald]], and the first state later called [[Darrok]] began to be created through trade.
