## Description

A long mountain range that splits [[Korhond]] and [[Belgosreim]]. It forms the Jargad cape to the south and is home to several tribes of the North, mainly [[Funsor]] and the giants of [[Hither]].

## History

Since ancient times, these mountains had a very bad reputation. This is imminent even from their shape: Wild and proud, full of chasms, caves, fjords, gorges and cliffs. The giants settled there first, and fought the Linnorms. Coming from [[Hoen]], Storm and Ice giants divided territories and carved runic stone houses on peaks, plateaus and foothills. From the time of the giants there are many buildings and relics in the mountains. The most important are [[Hitherun]], a fortress in the north, and the city of [[Hlafengrond]] in the northwestern foothills.

War followed the arrival of the giants. Their clans wanted absolute dominance in the region, and the Giant Wars shook the entire North. The signs of the battles can still be found in many parts of the mountains, from huge iron weapons to broken rocks and toppled stone fortifications. And even the Five Sages believe that if the War of the Giants had not taken place, they would have expanded and dominated the entire North.

The humans and orcs who came next took the language of the giants, but they could not live peacefully together. Soon, battles with the giants began. But only one faction of giants, the [[Hither]], were left with enough strength to hold off the endless waves of new arrivals. And soon most of the giants either retreated or hid in caves and chasms, except for [[Hitherun]]. Humans and orcs captured [[Hlafengrond]] and turned it into their own city.

The next fight was with the goblins. With [[Ginow]] as their base, they began to steal and plunder what they could in the mountains. After fierce clashes, they limited their activity to the southwest of the mountains. They still attack castaways, climbers and travelers, and occasionally raid [[Hlafen]], a village of sailors and fishermen.

The tribes then divided up the mountain areas, a division that included a lot of violence. To the northwest, the [[Kalenvad]] tribe settled in [[Hlafengrond]] and imposed strict laws over a large area, with a strong garrison to enforce them. To the northeast, on the opposite side of Hitherun moved the [[Funsor]] tribe, and built the city of [[Higg]]. Hlafengrond was filled with merchants, builders and warriors, but quickly became isolated from the rest of the clans under a peculiar monarchy regime.

Other, smaller tribes scattered into the remaining regions, but the constant danger of giants and goblins forced them to seek the more secluded places or abandon the mountains altogether. They in turn submitted to the oppression of the lowland tribes. This battle for dominance, paths, fortresses and resources, seems endless till today.
