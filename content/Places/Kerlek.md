A seclude hill in northeast [[Oromil]] from solid granite. It is home to a large family of dwarves. At ancient times, there was a gnome city below at the [[Deeps]], with many lost secrets, that the dwarves currently try to uncover. For this purpose, many gnomes come to visit here as pilgrims and they have made their own community.
