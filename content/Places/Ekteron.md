The vice capital of [[South Darrok]], this city boasts fine craftsmanship and artworks. It is considered by many one of the most important cities of the continent, as it connects many countries and is a major northern port. It contains many ancient temples, most notably the famous [[Nahema]] church of vitality with a devoted clergy.

 It was one of the biggest cities of the original [[Darrok]] region and many races lived there in harmony before it was split. It single handedly defied the embargo on [[North Darrok]] under King [[Labelas Lionhead]].

 The city was besieged during [[War of the Titan]] and [[Dumspergrond]] with his giants broke the walls and destroyed a huge part of the northern city. Thousands of townsfolk were killed. After the war, the city was rebuilt and many statues were assembled to commemorate the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone|heroes]] and [[Ildish|generals]] that saved the day.

 In the city the [[Weeping Eye]] were formed at 4786.
