A royal woodland, sacred to people from [[South Darrok]]. Hunting is prohibited here and it is considered a sacred place, as many trees were sculpted with jewels by an old [[Darrok]] queen, hence the name. The value of these precious trees was one of the reasons for the [[Decade War of Arbader and South Darrok]]. Many of those were plundered during the invasion at the start of the war.
