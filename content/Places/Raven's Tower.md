The smooth black granite that juts out from the steep northern shores of [[Rondorvick]] culminates in a huge pinnacle, full of holes and hollows, where falcons, albatross and other seabirds come and go. Many legends say that the tower of the falcon is the only place [[B'tolen]] chose to settle, and even then for a while. The winds here seem to never stop, carving strange shapes into the stone, and rumor has it that the Raven's Flight brought all these flocks of birds here.

Quite often, gatherings of druids, also known as Storm Flock, take place in the falcon's tower. The right to participate in a Flock are those druids who have managed to come to the island without a boat or other vessel and have lived a year on the island, as well as the leader from the giant Falcons of Rondor, who can and does communicate in the language of nature. The Flock decide on important matters to do with nature and preventing the expansion of civilization. The druids on the island have absolute authority, and often the young come here to apprentice under some old mentor. The Flock is led by the Caller, who decides when its gatherings will take place. The only order that the Flock obeys are the [[Fismint]] druids.

Until recently, the Caller of the Flock was [[Raefibb]], who decided to step down and leave the island permanently. The position is now empty, and gatherings are becoming more sparse than before. Although there are several candidates, the majority believe that it is better to wait for an ideal candidate than to initiate someone who won't be able to meet all the requirements.
