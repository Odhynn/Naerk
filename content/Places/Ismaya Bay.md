A huge island formation created at 2125 by a meteorite crash sent by [[Lebdegah]]. The damage from the impact was extensive, with tidal waves in many places to the west of [[Naerk]].

The area was soon filled with Vethians. Sometimes friendly, sometimes hostile, and sometimes just plain curious, they occupied the southern islands and built their civilization there: [[Azarradon]], [[Yagalshu]], [[Kleoktra]], [[Ubalnu]], and [[Bluqqa]]. Battles soon broke out from 2129 onwards with [[Drozzin]]'s dragons and [[Bloodscale]]. Four battles were fought, which had mutual losses and succeeded in defining the frontiers of the two rival peoples: the [[Siege of Gorin]], the [[Naval Battle of Girnea]], and the two [[Battles of Khaled-Bal]].

The area centered on the Ismaya Gulf gradually became unrecognizable. The Vethians used all the magic and knowledge they possessed to mutate all of Malahir's creations, living things: Fish became colorful or monstrous, forests turned yellow, animals and birds began to behave strangely. They built cities out of materials unknown, and the inhabitants were just as curious. One city looked like a beehive, another a snake hole, and as in distant [[Xe-Farom]], flying towers and floating houses appeared occasionally, powered by the [[Veth Crystals]] of the meteorite debris that spread across the bay.
