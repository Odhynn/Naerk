The wealthy and corrupted capital of Arbader, Hashnev is the seat of the king and the royal castle and palace. It features several walls and a fortified road to the port. The recently built towers of the high town resemble the vast accumulated wealth of the noble houses during the last decades. The biggest temples in the city are those of [[Sergonial]] and [[Xeurim]], both unique in their architecture and tower above most buildings. The most important building in the city, though, is the bank. Until recently, slave trade and gladiatorial duels in Marleon Arena were common. By recent [[Palaurim]] law, slavery was officialy abolished but still unofficialy a thing.
