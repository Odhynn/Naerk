the Boiling Fountain was created with the excess water from the [[Obunk]] lake after the [[Beast of Water and Death]] was defeated. It is a lake with a flame deep within it, causing the water to constantly boil. [[Oliven]] said this was to mark [[Fyrlean]]'s victory over the creation of [[Hydarax]].

The [[Boiling Fountain]] always has hot water and jets of water shoot out from its center, often reaching kilometers away. Jets are said to fly whenever Fyrlean and Hydarax fight within the [[Elemental Ring]].
