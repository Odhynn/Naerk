A near-abandonded sacred temple of the [[Edhellin]]. It was built on the waterfall of [[Kalwyn]] river and featured wondrous archs and pillars, with numerous waterfalls pouring to the sea. It was abandoned during the [[Day of Wild Magic]] and rebuilt for a brief period of time until the fall of the Edhellin. It is considered a sacred site, dedicated to [[Hydarax]] and is visited by elven pilgrims from time to time.
