The biggest activo volcano on the [[Paraselt]] mountain range and home of the dragon [[Solusmeir]]. It is the ancestral place of the Rall clan of the Fire Giants. They had previously attacked [[Tithlon]] many times, running after [[Kegrozal]]'s blasts, and wreaking havoc on the elves and half-elves of the area. They had a close alliance and cooperation with the dragons of the region, but when the eldest of them, [[Solusmeir]], along with his son [[Emberspark]] died in an attack on [[Ilistair]] in the year 4777, they took the opportunity to subjugate the [[Bloodscale]] and kobolds of the region. Since then their attacks on Tithlon have multiplied and the territory they conquer increases every month.
