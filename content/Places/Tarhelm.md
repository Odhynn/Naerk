## Description

Tarhelm is a colossal mountain range that splits the original country of [[Darrok]] to the [[Northern Darrok|North]] and the [[South Darrok|South]]. In the middle it is split by a giant gorge, formed by the [[Rod of Stone and Steel]] and the resulting river, [[Serpent's Tail]]. The tallest mountain is over 28000 feet and has the [[Four Winds Monastery]] on top. It also contains the iron fortress of [[Str√ºmeld]]. The range continues to the west to form the islands of [[Paltenach]], [[Urgol]], [[Skalenar]],[[Pegrel]] and [[Gelrah]].

## Inhabitats

The mountains are filled with numerous caves and [[Deeps]] tunnels with many orc and goblin tribes. Higher on the mountains, troll, stone and cloud giants live.
