A semi-independent island from [[Whistor]] rule. It is believed to be a refuge for pirates and a base for numerous illegal activities. Many sailors utilise it for underground trade.

## Black sheep of [[Whistor]]

The largest island of the [[Walgri Isles]], Brevilla was a constant thorn in [[Whistor]]'s administration and development. And this was for many reasons. First, it was the most remote island in the sea and the largest, which required autonomous administration in many matters. The responsible duke, based in [[Carlitta]], faced enormous problems. He had to contain the scourge of pirates, keep the Southern Trade Route safe and also deal with the island's internal dangers.

Each of these challenges was enormous. The pirates, based in [[Flame Gulf]], deserters of the four [[Second Battle of Flame Gulf|Naval Battles]], unaffiliated merchants and members of the [[Pirate Council]], wanted to increase their sphere of influence westward. Their raids were frequent already from the beginning of the fourth millennium, and Carlitta was among the first cities to be attacked. The city was burned and sacked five times in the first century, with countless inhabitants killed, while many were taken as slaves.

When the competent authorities and the Duchy realized how exposed Carlitta was, they built another port in the south of the island, protected and fortified with high walls. At the same time, the Southern Trade Route was shifted to the open sea, and ceased to pass through Carlitta for a long time, while merchants approached the island at their own risk. The reinforcement of Whistor's fleet, however, acted effectively to expel would-be pirates, and for a time the situation on the island normalized.

However, the joy of the inhabitants was temporary. And this, because the island was inhabited by creatures who did not look kindly on the new settlers, who were coming in increasing numbers. The completion of the new fortress was the last straw. Harpies, who lived in the west of the island, organized a strike force and attacked the fortress one moon with bows and sharp claws. The guards, inexperienced as they were in battle with such a fierce enemy, had no hope. The Harpies even called in Skinwalkers, Fiveclaws and other monsters and within a few minutes they killed the targets, opened the gates and the monsters poured into the city.

The massacre that followed is one of the darkest stories of [[Whistor]]. Those who managed to escape, ran to the ships for salvation, but many captains fled in terror long before the ships were full of refuges. Those who remained had no escape route: many fought to the death, others surrendered, and some were crushed by the rocks beneath the walls in a desperate attempt to escape. Few guards escaped alive.

However, the Harpies limited the senseless slaughter, contrary to what Whistor's official version states. The inhabitants soon realized that they were being given the opportunity to remain in the city, as the Harpies were hostile to the authorities and not the people. The change of administration was effected by a matriarchal Harpy council, which took over the military, economic, and religious administration of the city. Many merchants were relieved to be spared Whistor's taxation, while the new one was noticeably lower. The Harpies declared the independence of Brevilla and its new capital, [[Harpy Port]].

Whistor's fleet, with the threat of pirates and the stories of the massacre raging, was unable to respond. Two frenzied attacks were made, but the sailors who reached the island were either washed ashore or found themselves surrounded and trapped in various parts of the island. The [[Harpy Port]], now fully walled and fortified, was almost impossible to fall, while many soldiers were tortured exemplary on the shore, with their comrades looking on helplessly from the ships.

As for Carlitta, it too was unable to maintain her identity. After many supply problems, the locals were forced to expand into the nearby Darvass Swamps and Baracos Jungles. However, the local indigenous populations of lizardfolk, toadfolk, and other swamp creatures fought back. With a coordinated attack, in which they even had dinosaurs, they attacked Carlitta, which violently passed into their own control after its final destruction.

This was the final act that sealed the fate of the island. The Harpies and the lizardmen seemed to be the main pillars of the administration of the island, which was divided into their own spheres of influence. Since then, Brevilla became a den of pirates and all kinds of criminals and smugglers, with Whistor unable to control it, although it continued to be part of its territory.
