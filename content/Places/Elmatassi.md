## The River's Diamond

The [[Hithlen]] people built their capital on the [[River Ilmen]] bank, and named it Elmatassi, the diamond of the river.

Elmatassi is a city that is constantly growing, corresponding to the increasing wealth of the country [[Hithlwin]]. Watermills and windmills are build at the suburbs while cattle and mules plowed the nearby land daily, continuously feeding the growing needs of the inhabitants. The city contains marvelous wonders of architecture, towers and aqueducts build with marble from the river and with added gem and ivory decorations.
