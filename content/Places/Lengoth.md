An island in [[Sunshine]], east of the main island. It is inhabited by a lot of wizards from [[Gatewatch]]. At year 4105, after a failed experiment with [[Virryldians]], the uncontrolled magic fallout destroyed the [[Ol-Girrot]] port and forced many of the locals to move to other parts of the island. Since then, locals are very critic and unfriendly towards [[Gatewatch]] members.
