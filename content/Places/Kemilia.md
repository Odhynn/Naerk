The town that was built near [[Warm River]] when [[Kemil]] became known. A town with trade flourishing and strengthening the surrounding areas. It rallied numerous members of [[Ashiro's Legacy]]. This in turn led to kidnappings and sacrifices of non-elves began to be recorded and increased at an exponential rate. The government, however, did not dare to send an army to stop this situation as it estimated that the unrest that would be created by attacking an area "trade center" (and the possible suspension of exports from there as a sign of protest) would be far greater than those it had to deal with due to the disappearances and deaths.
