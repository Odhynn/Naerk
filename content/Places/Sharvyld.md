## Tribes

Northwest [[Fervolosh]] practically includes three main tribes: the [[Daral]], [[Skra]] and [[Volnoch]]. But it would be a big mistake to conclude that the area is simply divided between the three of them. Too many mysteries lie deep in the forest, which even the bravest either ignore or consciously avoid. Often, entire patrols of experienced warriors are lost, who under normal circumstances knew the paths of the forest better than anyone.

## Tiblithin

To the south is Tiblithin, an area that has been taken over by mushrooms. Mold has taken over all the trees there, like a disease, and many kinds of mushrooms are spreading, many of which are poisonous and dangerous, while others are hallucinogenic or go so far as to control the minds of those who touch them. Several monsters take refuge there, making the area even more dangerous, while even the most ancient trees are half-dried and have given way to all kinds of fungi. A few herbalists and alchemists like [[Hilgar]] find the place especially attractive to stock up on very hard-to-find ingredients.

## Tolberth

To the southeast is the fearsome Tolberth. The area practically belongs to the spiders. Webs cover the entire area, and several are as thick as rope, making the area completely inaccessible. The area's huge spiders terrify travelers, and it often forms the physical border between the Skra and the Daral. Entire patrols prefer to avoid the place rather than risk injury, poisoning, or even the loss of their warriors.

The west of these two regions border the Vylwir. An area that no one knows much about, since few have visited it and come back to tell what they saw. It is a piece of forest that communicates with the Evergrowing Forest. Scattered information says that the traveler gets lost in random places and gradually the forest thickens, darkens and becomes a hot jungle. There are creatures that have nothing to do with the north: Whoever turns back, again from random places, considers himself lucky and does not approach again. Few visitors, of course, consider the experience a trip that can be of great interest: An interest that often turns out to be fatal. Others know specific entrances and use Vylwir to smuggle.

Moving northeast, are the Baltsver Hills. These low hills are practically a continuation of the forest, but hippogriffs often make their nests in them. Villages of particularly aggressive Ogres often attack hippogryphs and cause problems for tribal soldiers. In the eastern roots lies Fymlerin, a village of Leshy, intelligent plants who live in seclusion and peace. Ogres have learned to avoid them from failed battles of the past.

To the north lies Lake Quspell, with a small hunter settlement to the north, Quarbolg. There are mostly tribal outcasts and various other undesirables or disenchanted, who have chosen to live in isolation in the forest. This was the limit the Wendigo had reached in ancient times, and they were stopped by a powerful dryad named Berevalia. From the lake begins the Quarfol, a river that flows north to the Volnoch, and on its banks is Shorglyn, a runestone dedicated to Valanshore, and her sacred stag, Valanfaul. The area ends at the grove of Swyrlifen, and then Lizthal, a Daral village, begins.

The region ends in Volanir, the capital of the Daral elves. One of the largest cities in the North, it has survived countless winters and raiders over time, and includes a strong military force as well as druids and rangers for protection. The city is home to many gifted metal, wood and leather craftsmen as well as various scholars and artists, a rare phenomenon by the standards of the wild north.
