Some refer to Drozzin as the land of Dragons. Many say it was where those dragons who disagreed with the Dragonpact went. It was a continent that already had too many dragons, and even more [[Bloodscale]] that had resulted from the dragons' contact with the natives of the area. This is also the area from which the first [[Bloodscale]] traveled to [[Oromil]], and then to the rest of [[Naerk]].

The dragons divided almost the entire island between them, and ruled entire cities built by Bloodscale, who often worshiped them as chosen ones of [[Klemnestron]]. Some dragons were even older than one, or even two, millennia. With their knowledge and wisdom, the cities they created were vast and imposing with [[Trienre]], [[Meezonax]], [[Irkanza]], [[Chelashiz]] and the capital city of [[Ednais]] being prime examples. The slow rate at which bloodscales reproduced limited hereditary and territorial rivalries, while the dragons made sure to severely punish anyone who challenged their power and choices.

However, gradually their influence was limited in the west with the advent of the [[Selanahr|Selanahrii]]. During the period of [[Selanahr]]'s decline, a small group of elves and humans migrated south, and made their first colony in [[Hegtrai]]. A mysterious area, full of fog and trees and uninhabited until then. With the situation in Selanahr deteriorating, they gradually within a few months became independent and went their own way. But in no case were they ready to surrender to the tyranny of the dragons, who from the first day in Drozzin began to demand a head tax from them, and began to kill those who could not pay.

The colonists tried to organize resistance, but they had lost. In the face of the destructive fury of the dragons, every battle seemed futile. But they were determined to fight, because back home a worse fate awaited them. This was something the dragons could not understand, so they believed they could be quickly driven back to Selanahr. Nevertheless, within two years, [[Toshiyuki]] and [[Hegtrai]] had been completely destroyed at least three times, with thousands dead and injured.

Determined to stay, the colonists found allies in the island's native fey. Nymphs, dryads and more, from tiny assassins to pranksters and sprites, came to their side. They were creatures that hid in the forests of [[Chiasa]], and had in the past also suffered greatly from the ferocity of dragons and [[Bloodscale]]. Joining forces, they managed to disorient the dragons and hide refugees in the forests. The ensuing battles left many dead on the Bloodscale side as well, while two ancient dragons died in a raid on the [[Kalusi river]].

After these events, the dragons stopped raiding. They realized that attacks there would be futile, and quickly found that they could not replace their dead as easily as the settlers did. Soon they were content with small skirmishes in the outskirts, which still drag on, while gradually in Ednais several traders came and settled, paying the corresponding servitude tax. Ednais gradually became the definitive border of the two cultures, who learned to respect each other.

In recent years, [[Palaurim]] sent an exhibition to settle in the northeastern shores, composed primarily of [[Sergonial]] clergy and outcasts. They established a foothold and a fortified dock AT [[Newport]].
