One of the largest cities in the North, it has survived countless winters and raiders over time, and includes a strong elven military force as well as druids and rangers for protection. The city is home to many gifted metal, wood and leather craftsmen as well as various scholars and artists, a rare phenomenon by the standards of the wild north. It is the capital of the [[Daral]] elven tribe.
