## Here Be Monsters

From the very first fishing boats that sailed in Lokkam Sea, the waters quickly got a bad reputation. Besides a very dangerous current, that threw the ships to break in the Fjord of the [[Walrus Shores]], besides the very difficult weather phenomena and the bitter cold, the sailors feared something else. The currents and waves knew how to deal with them, but not the creatures of the sea.

The main reason for deep sea travel was either Narval and whale hunting, or coastal trade between [[Belgosreim]] and [[Bj√•glant]]. The brave fishermen, sailors and traders were quickly shocked. Ships began to be lost and you never knew why, while fear multiplied when there were survivors. Huge whales with giant jaws that even tore wood from ships, water snakes whose tails disappeared into unimaginable distances, and squids with huge tentacles that wrapped even the largest ships.

And yet, the temptation of money pushed more and more people into these dangerous journeys. Most came from the south, as the locals neither had the equipment nor the will to challenge their fate, not wanting to incur Jalerk's wrath. They were content with small and well-known routes and fished only to meet their needs.

Until the year 4734, all incidents of ship attacks were isolated and not very frequent. Occasionally a boat would sink or someone would die, but after a few months it was just history for the kids. But then the Kraken appeared.

Within a month, three ships were sunk in the north, with no survivors. Most people thought it was a coincidence and didn't bother, but the fourth ship that sank to the north had survivors. Those who turned back seemed to have gone completely mad, and told stories of huge tentacles reaching up to the sky before bursting onto the ship and crushing it.

Soon most thought that these were exaggerations for some big squid, and that as crazy as the witnesses were they were not a reliable source. But when the whalers resumed their voyages to the north, the disasters continued. And in fact the last ship reported that this creature followed them.

When the locals heard this, they realized that the fishermen had angered Jalerk, and she was seeking revenge. Storm clouds had begun to spread and lightning to fall. In many villages they made sacrifices to appease her and covered their houses with human blood. In these villages, the tentacles appeared, but did no damage, apart from a few overturned boats.

In the other villages, however, the Kraken showed no mercy. Houses were destroyed, piers were broken up, and ships were sunk. The inhabitants were grabbed by the tentacles and eaten alive, crushed or thrown onto the rocks. The monster's destructive fury did not stop until it had devoured the last inhabitant within reach with its tentacles. And this continued in the rest of the villages and ports.

Until, in Keldrev, after a meeting of the residents and contact with the shamans of the area, it was decided to offer a standing sacrifice to prevent the Kraken from advancing further, as they were next in line. They attacked the whaling guild, captured two captains and sacrificed them on a stone in a fjord. And they wrote with their blood on the stone, above where the wave broke, that every year they would repeat the sacrifice so that the Kraken would not attack again.

In all they captured seventy-six whalers, as the rest made off. Thus they managed to appease the beast for several years, although the reputation of their incredible brutality spread to the rest of the villages. Deep sea hunting was banned and calm prevailed.

In the year 4768, on the day of the ceremony, an armored ship appeared in Keldrev. All the sailors looked like armored warriors, and on his bow was a carved bear. Their leader, who introduced himself as Snafr, went in wild moods and freed the last captives. He told the whole village that the Kraken should start fearing them, not the other way around. Anyone who dared to hinder him was found unconscious on the ground, while some of Rogov's clan followed him, And his ship was refloated in the northern ocean.

A few weeks later, his ship, windswept, battered, returned to Keldrev. A dozen sailors had all survived on it, along with Snafr. And they spread tales of the battle, and how they fatally seized the beast and drove it into the depths of the ocean. And they brought from the ship a tentacle ten meters long, and feasted in the village, eating the boiled soup, although several were hesitant and stayed away. Because they knew that sooner or later, the Kraken would return.
