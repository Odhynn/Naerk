One of the most important rivers pouring from [[Paraselt]] is the Ilmen. This river is considered among the longest in all of [[Naerk]], for it runs thousands of miles to the east, feeds the southern plains of [[Tithlon]], and passes below [[Edhelwood]], continuing east into the region called [[Hithlwin]] until it reaches the sea of [[Vaylen Sea|Vaylen]].

Many centuries ago, Ilmen was a chaotic river, full of dense forests and vegetation. Wild elves and tribes lived there, with ever-fluctuating populations. The largest race of people was in the east, near the river delta. They were called [[Hithlen]]. The Hithlen, unlike the other tribes in the west, had a constant population growth and development. This was mainly because they had developed their agriculture, as the lands half the length of the river were fertile plains, and they were sown everywhere. The Hithlen then also built their capital on the river bank, and named it [[Elmatassi]], the diamond of the river. Thus, [[Hithlwin]] started to spread.
