Ilistair is a city featuring beautiful stonework made from [[Darrok]] stonemasons. The main temple is dedicated to [[Yerastu]] and has several high-ranking priests. It was attacked by [[Solusmeir]] and [[Bloodscale]] acolytes in the year 4777 and was saved at last moment by an avatar of [[Hikari]] that took over [[Shizu]]'s body and killed the dragon in a fierce battle. The temple and the city outskirts suffered heavy damage and hundreds of townsfolk and priests were killed.
