To the east of [[Oromil]], south of the wastelands of [[Rammok Wastes|Rammok]], lies another large wasteland. One of the most characteristic landmarks of the area are the Sand Pillars, later known as the Howling Pillars. These are huge columns of sand and rock, over fifty yards in height. Many of them have pits and caves, inhabited by beasts of many kinds. The Sand Pillars are a sign to avoid for most caravans that pass through the area. Even the veteran [[Gheren Steed]] mercenaries avoid the place. And that's because the Sand Pillars were supposedly created by [[Il'vec]]'s swarm: Millions of weeds and insects made their nests here with sand and saliva, then were abandoned once Il'vec was defeated.

A group of [[Warclaw]]s, servants of [[Karadosh]], later developed in this area. With occult rites at the waning of the moon, they gave worshipers animal form. Their circle expanded on a monthly basis, until it ended up numbering several hundred, among them many Gnolls, werewolf hybrids, skinwalkers, and fiveclaw. Soon no one was safe in the area. At the height of their power, they joined with the Gnolls of the eastern [[Karrokh]] and attacked the [[Green Hills]] with great fury, in a slaughter of incessant wars and battles that lasted from 4082 to 4215, with great loss and destruction to the Green Hills in cities and outdoors.

This circuit seemed to be strengthened by extraterrestrial help, in the form of demons, allies of Karadosh. Ceremonies were now becoming a routine affair and many gnoll tribes had migrated permanently to the area. Despite the efforts of neighboring states to contain the threat, the Warclaws constantly bounced back. Then, at the beginning of the year 4778, several nomads joined them, under the leadership of the priest [[Voldrak]], bringing a definitive end to the civil war in the region. Now nobody knows who or if will stop them if they start the raids, which sooner or later is inevitable.
