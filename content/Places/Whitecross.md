A city that was traditionally superstitious against nonhumans. Just before [[War of Karahath]] broke out, the allied dragon [[Kereilanzoga]] burned the city, inflicting huge casualties. Soon after [[Kenorex]] agents stormed the city and started a coup that a few months later ended with the city in [[Kambah]] hands. All [[Oventhart]] loyalists were hunted down and the city became a base of operations for [[Karahath]]'s armies advancing on [[Cavaroch Forest]].

Several decades later at 4817, Whitecross was once again burned by a dragon that thought the thieves of her eggs were hiding in the city.
