## Description

A city that was traditionally superstitious against nonhumans. Just before [[War of Karahath]] broke out, the allied dragon [[Kereilanzoga]] burned the city, inflicting huge casualties. Soon after [[Kenorex]] agents stormed the city and started a coup that a few months later ended with the city in [[Kambah]] hands. All [[Oventhart]] loyalists were hunted down and the city became a base of operations for [[Karahath]]'s armies advancing on [[Cavaroch Forest]]. Several decades later at 4817, Whitecross was once again burned by a dragon that thought the thieves of her eggs were hiding in the city.

## History

Whitecross as a city first appears during the heyday of [[Oventhart]], around the year 3500. Having a strategic position next to the [[Roaring Strait]], it became a trading center that connected the [[Misty Sea]] with the Strait. This meant that it could control all the ships that passed through the area and with the customs it grew rich and grew. Its trade relations with [[Tarthyn]] and [[Green Hills]] were quite good, although with [[Sunshine]] they gradually decreased for unknown reasons. The first partner was Tarthyn as until a time there were many elves in Whitecross and they had great power and friendship with their neighbors.

However, relations with Tarthyn also suddenly broke off, around the year 4400. The obvious reason was Tarthyn's refusal to pay excessively high taxes and freight to Whitecross. However, the real cause was the hate speech that Whitecross repeatedly expressed towards the elves and gnomes of Tarthyn. It is very possible that even the tax increase was due to the superstition. Since then, Tarthyn has permanently cut off routes to and from Whitecross.

At that time, the city's hatred for the elves began to extend to the elves of Oventhart itself. The elves of the city considered the humans responsible for what had happened, and the people said that the elves only wanted them to have trade relations with Tarthyn. The two races began to hate each other and the city practically split in two. Tarthyn, however, was a central trading center, and Whitecross was violently impoverished as it suddenly found itself having lost 2/3 of its trade.

In a situation that ranged from verbal attacks to violent clashes on both sides, the city was taken over by the wizard [[Nuzzad]] in the year 4728, who guaranteed its security. However, as he was human, everyone noticed that he took measures that were particularly favorable to them. On the contrary, he rapidly increased taxation on the elves, until he practically led to their expulsion from the city. All this was more or less known to the king of Oventhart, but most believe that due to the Ashiro legacy it was difficult to see that the king took a position in favor of one side or the other. Within a year of Nazzad's appearance, the elves had left Whitecross. In the autumn of 4772, the huge red dragon [[Kereilanzoga]] appeared and burned Whitecross. The destruction in the city was enormous, but it was able to recover.

After that time, everyone noticed that the city had suspiciously improved her trade with Kambah, and it was not long before the first [[Kenorex]] appeared in the city. At first, they did not present themselves as citizens of [[Kambah]], but as a battalion of volunteers who helped rebuild the city. Within a few months, with the [[War of Karahath|Kambah attack on Oventhart]], the city officially passed under Kambah control with minimal fighting. The gates were closed and no one could leave. Those who dared to react were hanged as an example in the city's arena. It is said that for four hours they hung dissidents by the dozens and by the end of the day there were six hundred corpses.

During the war, Whitecross remained as a supply station for the [[Kenorex]]. The dragon that burned the city died in a duel to the north with another dragon. Oventhart's army never approached the city nor did it consider it a central strategic target for recapture. The city was very well fortified and very close to Kambah and any such move would have cost a lot. Especially after the recapture of Kambah, the Oventhart losses were very high and what they wanted above all was peace. Since the beginning of the war, the refugees had found refuge in Dalurie, the reoccupied fortress of Cavaroch and as it was rebuilt with the help of the elves and Oventhart most decided to stay there permanently.

In the year 4817 a red dragon, [[Sartharia]], suddenly appeared and burned the city for the second time. Most believe that it was the mate of the first dragon and did so because it thought that its eggs had been stolen and hidden in the city. The second disaster was not as great as the first, and the city quickly recovered, now officially with the help of Kambah. It has now developed into the country's main commercial port and shipyards have been built, from which many of the ships that participated in the [[Battle of Misty Sea]] left.
