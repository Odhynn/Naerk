The Fortress of Aar was built by orcs to defend against their violent tribal kin. Its inhabitants later joined [[Kenorex]] at year 40703 under warlord [[Fasroh]]'s reign. Afterwards, it became the seat of power for all subsequent tyrrants of [[Kenorex]] and defacto leaders of [[Kambah]]. [[Karahath]], the supreme tyrrant, carved his majestic stone seat here at the main city keep.
