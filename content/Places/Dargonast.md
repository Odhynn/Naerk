A city that was constantly attacked by goblins of Paraselt. At 3125, such an attack was the cause for the foundation of [[Luminous Order]] from the priests of [[Laerion]] to defend the city. It was destroyed in 4816 by a goblin invasion, organised by the [[Defeated Army]] in [[Paraselt]]. It is slowly being rebuild.
