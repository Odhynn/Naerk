**The Pale Moon**

Na'erk's second and smallest moon is also known as the Dead Giant or Pale Titan by those who know more about it. To the rest of the world it is known as Veth, the pale moon. In fact, this moon is a [[Primordial]], an ancient mighty being that died by the [[Equalizer]] when the world was still young in a [[Primordial War|battle of colossal proportions]] because he defied the laws of [[Material Plane]] and invented his own with some help from [[Nahema]]. Its body was kept as an example to what would happen if anyone defied the Equalizer. Since then, its shape has become almost spherical and compressed due to gravity. 

Veth's invasion on the Material Plane was accompanied by a series of apocalyptic events that shocked Na'erk. His very existence challenged the rules of the Material Plane set by the Equalizer. When he died, the vast energy at his disposal began to release in various ways. The Fathomless Force it radiates is responsible for the arcane magic (the radiance of Veth) in Naer'k. Too many creatures, gods and mortals, tried to use it, either directly by their own effort, by inheriting this power from their Vethfolk ancestors, or through the help of other beings or nature itself.

Initially, this energy fell onto the surface of Na'erk in the form of radiation, which essentially created a first form of magic. This form quickly became apparent to everyone that it differed from the powers used by the elemental lords, or from the spells of the gods and their followers. Sometimes Veth's arcane effects were a pure form of force and in other instances his power was fueled from the elemental dimensions. Some were born with a unique ability to manage this magic, while others could by hard study understand it and bring it under their control. Many of Veth's creatures have survived, and are known as Vethians. Strange and misunderstood beings, some of them (Vethralls) found shelter in [[Tartara|Tartarus]], while most of them (Vethians) left for the [[Zinctizuctra|Scream Fields]] they created.

Veth has a full moon every 10 months. When the astral body of [[Qusm]] conjunt with Veth and Na'erk, then the magic in Na'erk ceases, while the Qusm's Portals open to all dimensions, creating infinite silver trays of cosmic paths. During this occasion, many wanderers use them to move from dimension to dimension. This event happens every 21 years.  On one occasion a crystal formation of [[Veth Crystals]] dropped on Na'erk, forming the mysterious [[Veth Spikes]]. On another, at year 2125, a meteorite from Veth was dropped south by [[Lebdegah|an Elder Vethian]], exploded and formed Ismaya Gulf and [[Iazip]]. The latest conjunction happened on the winter of year 4817, and was a [[Vethfall|cataclysmic event]] that changed how magic works in Na'erk.
