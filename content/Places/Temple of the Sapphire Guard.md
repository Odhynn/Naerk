An ancient temple built on the foot of a steep mountain in the territory of the clans of Thunder in [[Sennarin]]. Blue in color, it was built four centuries ago and houses priests of [[Sigard]] and [[Yerastu]], as well as creatures from the [[Fortress of the Just]] and [[Utopia]]. Councils are often held here on important secular or moral issues, trials, and pilgrims and priests often visit the place for advice. It houses artifacts of old and is also a court for major offenders that abuse magic or their powers.
