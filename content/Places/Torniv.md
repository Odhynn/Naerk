The Stone House was built after the Northmen of Korhond and [[Belgosreim]] emerged victorious from their battles against the goblins and giants, as well as overcomed the [[Ferelga]] plague.

 Numerous runes were carved in Torniv to honor the Aspects and old heroes, many of them with powerful protection spells. On the first day of Perlon (Summer), at summer solstice, people gather from all the tribes whose names are written there and celebrate. Then, the feats that had been accomplished by the victors of VÃ¸lrad, also known as Voldosh, are sculpted and immortalized over the centuries. Even in times of armed conflict between some of the tribes, the warriors put down their weapons, participate in the sacred ceremonies dedicated to the commemoration and honoring of heroes and deeds and witness the sagas and songs from the glorious old days.
