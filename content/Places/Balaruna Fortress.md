From the early years of [[Hithlwin]]'s founding in 4363, the [[Hithlen]] senate was the highest body in the land. This was at the same time the only factor that could guarantee its prosperity and stability, at a time when the various regions wanted a greater share in the exercise of power. For their protection, they founded a special monastery, also known as Balaruna Fortress, in which a special unit of warriors, the [[Swords of Balaruna]], began to be trained hard from babies.
