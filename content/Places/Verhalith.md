>*In the heart of the forest, the fairies began to expand a beautiful city. It had blue and green buildings, made of woven wood, moss, and rocks that shimmered with all shades of green. Satyrs, gnomes, and centaurs came and settled, and the music of the city echoed throughout the forest, inviting creatures to join in the growing spirit of euphoria. And in [[Talyrian]]â€™s presence, the music grew louder and the colors more vivid. [[Portals]] appeared in the city, and messengers and visitors from every conceivable place teleported in.*

A magnificent city, made with gems, entagling plants and flowers by [[Talyrian]] after the [[Ghost War]]. It is inhabited by fey and its location is hidden deep in [[Kelonarie]] and the [[Forest of Tears]].
