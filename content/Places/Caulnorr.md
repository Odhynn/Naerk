The biggest surviving city and fort of the ancient Cyclops civilisation. They have numerous gnoll serfs and they have constructed massive walls hundreds of miles long to protect them from desert invasions. The dimensions of their city walls are enormous, and the place is both impregnable and a natural desert frontier. They have a very unique law and tradition system that helped them survive numerous challenges over the millenia and most of their neighbors learned to respect them and avoid them.
