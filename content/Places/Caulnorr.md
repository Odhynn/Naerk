The biggest surviving city and fort of the ancient Cyclops civilisation. The dimensions of their city walls are  enormous, and the place is both impregnable and a natural desert frontier. They have a very unique law and tradition system that helped them survive numerous challenges over the millenia and most of their neighbors learned to respect them and avoid them.

## Cyclopean Walls

They have numerous gnoll servants and have constructed massive walls hundreds of miles long to protect them from desert invasions. These huge walls that the cyclops had built two millennia ago were to protect themselves from the attacks of both hobgoblins and desert nomads. The walls are practically habitable in many places. They reach a thickness and height of sixty feet, extend for more than eighty miles, and took nearly two centuries to build, as well as immense mining in many places. They start at the sea, pass through the town of Caulnorr and end in the [[Blackwoods]].
