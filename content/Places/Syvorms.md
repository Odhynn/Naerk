The third biggest city of [[Imtaria]] and the place where [[Palaurim]] was first signed. Syvorms is the biggest merchant destinataion in the [[Misty Sea]] as it connects many regions and trade routes. The city is also the base of operations for the Syvorms Chartographic Society (SCS), that made most of the [[Naerk]] maps up to date.

The castle is also the ancestral seat of the Ragas Emperor family.
