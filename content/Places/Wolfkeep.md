The city was originally named Galasur.

In the year 4753, a traveler visited [[Oromil]]. It was [[Alerius]], and his arrival would change the region forever. Alerius had come from [[Karrokh]], and was one of the victims of the massacre of [[Tas-Roch]] by the werewolves. Unbeknownst to himself, he was a [[werewolf]]. And settling in Galasur, every full moon he changed form, and committed inhuman acts of savagery on unsuspecting neighbors. No one suspected him, and no one ever found any evidence to incriminate him.

Soon, more and more people in the neighborhood were affected by the curse. And within no time, they expanded to the entire city. Eventually anyone who wasn't a werewolf was in danger: for many victims died before the hungry beasts satisfied their rage. Within months, it was no longer an open secret, and the entire city was now inhabited by werewolves. This became the new reality: many left to save themselves, and the werewolves organized the city around their own needs.

The city was renamed Wolfkeep, and a leader named [[Solthys]] Hollard emerged, who took over the administration of the city and raids in the surrounding areas. Travelers, horses, caravans and traders, soon no one was safe in the [[Sneaky Savannah]] until the [[Teilkan Fields]]. Thousands of werewolves were now raiding and it soon became organized. Alerius had realized his mistake: although a werewolf, he abhorred all these acts of rage, cannibalism and violence. He secretly contacted Solthys' son, [[Seff]], to dethrone his father.

They found several followers in their attempt, and one night, in the winter of 4755, they murdered him, along with his loyal servants. Seff, in order to keep the cohesion of the city, was also declared warlord himself, but he significantly reduced the raids. But the situation in the city was very bad. Famine had gripped all the inhabitants, and soon many began to desert Seff to begin wanton raiding.
