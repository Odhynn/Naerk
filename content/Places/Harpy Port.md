A fortified city under strict rule by six harpy sisters and their guards: Melissara, Melady, Ligeia, Xaphirena, Thalia and Zephyra.

## History

The island of [[Brevilla]] was inhabited by creatures who did not look kindly on the new settlers, who were coming in increasing numbers. The completion of a new administrative fortress was the last straw. Harpies, who lived in the west of the island, organized a strike force and attacked the fortress one moon with bows and sharp claws. The guards, inexperienced as they were in battle with such a fierce enemy, had no hope. The Harpies even called in Skinwalkers, Fiveclaws and other monsters and within a few minutes they killed the targets, opened the gates and the monsters poured into the city.

The massacre that followed is one of the darkest stories of [[Whistor]]. Those who managed to escape, ran to the ships for salvation, but many captains fled in terror long before the ships were full of refuges. Those who remained had no escape route: many fought to the death, others surrendered, and some were crushed by the rocks beneath the walls in a desperate attempt to escape. Few guards escaped alive.

However, the Harpies limited the senseless slaughter, contrary to what Whistor's official version states. The inhabitants soon realized that they were being given the opportunity to remain in the city, as the Harpies were hostile to the authorities and not the people. The change of administration was effected by a matriarchal Harpy council, which took over the military, economic, and religious administration of the city. Many merchants were relieved to be spared Whistor's taxation, while the new one was noticeably lower. The Harpies declared the independence of Brevilla and its new capital, Harpy Port.
