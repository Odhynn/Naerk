This sea, famous for its tidal waves and storms, starts from [[Raven's Tower]], encircles [[North Darrok]], [[Korhond]] and [[Belgosreim]] until it reaches [[Bj√•glant]] shores. Numerous sailors have found a watery grave in these waters, and those that do survive tell unsettling tales of sea monsters.
