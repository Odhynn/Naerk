A volcanic island in east [[Whistor]]. It hosts a strong [[Whistor]] army garison and is also a sacred place for firefolk pilgrims, due to [[Haza Vulca]]. It is heavily fortified with warriors, walls, pyres and catapults, both in [[Dobroporte]] and in [[Fort Demorado]].

## History

The first inhabitants of Demorado were originally natives of the [[Walgri Isles]]. The legend in their stories says that the north from the south island was cut off by a blow of a huge titan and [[Yerastu]] punished him by locking him in the volcano [[Haza Vulca|Haza]]. The natives, fishermen and micro-craftsmen mainly, were soon marginalized and integrated into the settler societies that came in the period 3500-3700 mainly from [[Imtaria]]. The greatest alienation occurred a little later, when in the year 3837 the volcano Haza erupted and destroyed most of the fishing villages. This was a center of attraction for many firefolk settlers, who traveled mainly from [[Paraselt]] and [[Flame Gulf]]. Most of the natives since lost their customs and traditions, while the only thing that practically exists that reminds of their existence is the name of the islands.

The society of the islands was mainly structured around the port of [[Dobroporte]]. The firefolk who came turned it into a central hub of the South Trade Route and a military base for the entire Whistor. They built a fortress in the mountains, Demorado, and strengthened it so that it could repel the pirate raids that began with the flourishing of trade. A cathedral of Fyrlean was built at the base of the mountain and became a centre of attraction for even more firefolk and believers, as well as many craftsmen. Many of them went to [[Haza Vulca|Haza]] volcano to make a pilgrimage to the [[Fyrlean|Elemental Lord of Fire]], as it was considered a sacred place in their faith, and there were not a few who settled permanently on the island. Ceremonies take place at the summer solstice and on other days each year, with catapults throwing flames, dancing, and fire games.

Trade supplied the island's port and markets with many exotic goods. The locals proved to be skilled craftsmen, as they began to process and export metal objects and weapons. Near the volcano they also built a mine that extracted rare reddish metals: Fyrlith and Gorlith, which they processed exclusively and then sold to merchants at exorbitant prices. At the same time, they equipped the island's garrison with these weapons and armor and strengthened the defenses of the place with the profits. Its garrison, the Fyrlean Gaze, put on scarlet helmets and a mark on the forehead of the elemental lord of Fire. Massive walls were built in Demorado from black rocks that were melted, reshaped and reinforced with crafting secrets and magic that only the [[Fyrlean]]'s church knew.

Demorado soon gained its own self-government with a duke and became a central hub of trade and defense for the entire [[Whistor]]. The merchant guild of [[Destino Apprecio]] invested in the place by opening many shops and sending ambassadors, craftsmen and merchants. Its port expanded and connected the north with its south with canals and bridges. Jewelers, metalworkers and artists began to create works of unique beauty, while there were not a few gnomes who gradually settled in the city.

His army successfully repelled all pirate raids near the island and no siege could penetrate its walls. During the [[700 Days of Shadow|two years of Shadow]], the priests of Fyrlean armed with flaming weapons and fire spells drove the undead from the island six times with overwhelming victories, and refused to join the Holy Synod Divinalis. In the crisis of [[Brevilla]], they contributed dozens of ships to two attacks but could not gain control of it. In the raids of the pirate Valus, it was the only island of the Walgri that pirates didn't land at all, after a fierce naval battle and siege that cost him eleven galleys and eight hundred dead.

The northern island, Geritta, was too rugged to accommodate a functional port. It remained a small fishing village for smaller ships and for exiles, as well as for less legal activities. The threat of a possible eruption of Haza makes it a particularly dangerous place, while it is not rare for an earthquake to cause significant damage to structures and endanger locals.
