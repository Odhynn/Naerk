A narrow corridor formed on the low tide after a demonic ceremony. The [[Vile Septet]] conducted it with powerful energy drawn from [[Styx]] for their need to pass the army towards [[Lamerpad]] and [[South Darrok]]. Crimson icy spikes appeared along the route and froze the lowered sea level, forming a red corridor of ice.

In that place the faithful [[Darrok]]'s counterattack took place, but the alchemist [[Alzagur]] flooded part of the line, causing the attacking force to be at a great disadvantage against the demons.

After a ferocious battle, the death of [[La-Vermenel]] caused an explosion that melted the ice of the Bloodline. This sent the thin strip of land under the sea, cutting [[Olgizmar]] off from Darrok for good. Water covered the entire battlefield and sent the dead under the waves, which had turned crimson. No one since has dared to approach this point for centuries.
