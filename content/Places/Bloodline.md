A narrow corridor formed on the low tide after a demonic ceremony. The [[Vile Septet]] conducted it with powerful energy drawn from [[Styx]] for their need to pass the army towards [[Lamerpad]] and [[South Darrok]]. Crimson icy spikes appeared along the route and froze the lowered sea level, forming a red corridor of ice.
