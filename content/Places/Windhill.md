A tall hill amidst the desert plains of [[Allwick]] that is constantly ravaged by strong winds. It is a sacred place of the god [[Saekla]] and his followers occasionaly make pilgrimages here. This area of ​​perpetual sandstorms is chosen by shamans to communicate with the [[Elemental Ring]] and with ancient spirits to learn events of the past.
