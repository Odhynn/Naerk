Ral'Zoton is the ancestral place of the Rall fire giant clan. They consider themselves the true descendants of the southern Sun Giants from the [[Lan'Tui]] empire and recognize no stronger force in the mountains. Their power is terrifying, yet they have centuries to attack southern [[Oromil]]. They have established trade relations with [[Hoarinhel]], and export metals, weapons and rare gems. Their power is immense and their city is imposing and vast in size.
