A majestic giant city, carved into [[Thunder Mountain]]. It has giant stone halls and columns and is the best example of what remains of the old [[Gadrunen]] empire. Carved out of the mountains and ice, the chambers of the king of Thunder Mountain have huge windows to let in light from both sides and reach just below the [[Thunder Mountain]] summit, sacred to the giants. In height the rooms and corridors reach two hundred feet.
