The city of Pamfuhl (or Tarfuhl in Orcish) has a unique peculiarity: it is the only city in the north inhabited by people from five different tribes. This happened because the territories of all five races reached as far as the mouth of the [[Norfol]] and the [[Foltar]] Mountains. In these mountains lived the [[Dal'Vorag]] tribe, in the east as far as the [[Ã…perbung]] the [[Bur'gg]], in the southwest the [[Arlas]] cultivated the few summer months and from the mouth of the [[Norfol]] the [[Volkash]] fishermen went upstream north in the summer months. But originally, Norfol was inhabited by the [[Baldosh]] tribe, whose territory was constantly limited by the previous four races.

In the year 2427 the first clashes between the [[Dal'Vorag]] and the [[Baldosh]] began, when the former wanted to expand into the lowlands of the river. After fierce fighting, the Baldosh managed to stop the Dal'Vorag with the help of the [[Arlas]], but not before they had lost large areas, which the Wise Dragon's tribe never managed to regain. The Arlas also profited, as they secured their rear without losing any territory, while for their help to the Baldosh they gained access to Norleg via a road.

The [[Bur'gg]] wanted access to the sea, and the only way to achieve this was via the river. They constantly sought a channel of communication, and eventually realized that the exchange of goods was the easiest solution. The animal furs they brought, as well as the fish of the lake, were coveted by the other tribes, and so several were able to settle permanently on the eastern shore of Norfol.

Thus, timidly, the temporary settlements of these five tribes drew closer and closer, until they were unified in Tarful, a city that includes residents not only from these five but also from many more tribes that come here. The city council consists of members of all five tribes, while it is not uncommon for foreigners and travelers to be elected to office, if they are known in the city or have contributed a lot to its prosperity. Tarful is a rare example of hostile tribes living together. In the entire history of the city, only two violent clashes have occurred within, with dozens of victims, but even these incidents in so many centuries of the city's existence are insignificant compared to other bloody battles between tribes.
