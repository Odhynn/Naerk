A firefolk castle with access to both north and south sides of the narrow part in [[Demorado]] island. Northern port is a military and fishermen base and south port is used mostly to traders.

The society of the island is mainly structured around the port of [[Dobroporte]]. The firefolk who came turned it into a central hub of the South Trade Route and a military base for the entire Whistor. They built a fortress in the mountains, Demorado, and strengthened it so that it could repel the pirate raids that began with the flourishing of trade. A cathedral of Fyrlean was built at the base of the mountain and became a centre of attraction for even more firefolk and believers, as well as many craftsmen. Many of them went to [[Haza Vulca|Haza]] volcano to make a pilgrimage to the [[Fyrlean|Elemental Lord of Fire]], as it was considered a sacred place in their faith, and there were not a few who settled permanently on the island. Ceremonies take place at the summer solstice and on other days each year, with catapults throwing flames, dancing, and fire games.

Trade supplies the island's port and markets with many exotic goods. The locals are skilled craftsmen, as they process and export metal objects and weapons. The rare metals Fyrlith and Gorlith arrive from the volcano mines, are processed exclusively and then sold to merchants at exorbitant prices. At the same time, the island's garrison is equipped with these weapons and armor and strengthened the defenses of the place with the profits. Its garrison, the Fyrlean Gaze, wears scarlet helmets and bears a mark on the forehead of the elemental lord of Fire. Massive walls were built in Demorado from black rocks that were melted, reshaped and reinforced with crafting secrets and magic that only the [[Fyrlean]]'s church knew.

The merchant guild of [[Destino Apprecio]] invested in the place by opening many shops and sending ambassadors, craftsmen and merchants. Its port is expanded and connected from north to south with canals and bridges. Jewelers, metalworkers and artists create works of unique beauty, while there are many gnomes in the city that practice their unique crafts.
