In the year 3973, after the Treaty of [[Palaurim]], a second city appeared, which began to gain power quickly. Erstal was originally a town of a few merchants, which soon gained enormous power. They declared independence from the sultan's influence and began trading with [[Imtaria]] and [[Whistor]] without any control from the country's central administration. The Sultan could not leave this fact unanswered and the [[Siege of Erstal]] begun.
