An independent and secluded town ruled by the Three Cripples. Entry is prohibited to most outsiders.

## Crones of Salgavento

A fairly remote city, Salgavento was a port that had no land connection to other cities. This was because the [[On-Herja]] desert was notoriously dangerous, both due to heat and water scarcity, and because of the various monsters that were found there. Even the bravest caravan traders preferred the southern route from [[Almarica]] to [[Walajat]]. It was a much safer and more profitable route.

But there was another reason why traders avoided Salgavento. And that was that Salgavento traditionally had a bad history with both payments to merchants and taxes in Whistor in general. This was due to the fact that many pirates used the city as their base, buying up properties there with false credentials and saving gold in the local bank. Apparently this was caused great damage to the business of [[Destino Apprecio]], who officially asked the king to put an end to the lawlessness of the city. Administrative officials were sent with the responsibility of settling the city's financial affairs.

And then the [[700 Days of Shadow|Two Years of Shadow]] began. The sky turned black over the city and the spirits of the dead walked the alleys and haunted the residents. The people locked themselves in their houses in fear and the undead roamed everywhere. The local authorities were unable to restore order and reports of deaths multiplied every day.

It was then that three large figures, covered in rags, arrived in the city. Each had six fierce giants as servants, armed with magical weapons and armor made of Gorlith, the metal of [[Haza Vulca|Haza volcano]]. They imposed order by force and seized power, pushing aside [[Whistor]]'s loyalists. Immediately, they put into effect a series of rules that defined the city's absolute submission to their orders and respect for their authority. Anyone who broke these laws was led to the central square and thrown into thorny cages that were hung on cranes.

The next step was to begin ceremonies with human sacrifices to the [[demons]] of the [[Abyss]]. The runners-up were usually those in the cells, but there were cases when they caught someone based on their appearance or some characteristic that made them suitable for the ceremony. The ceremonies continued at a constant pace. All the houses were painted with demonic writing and then suddenly the undead and shadows disappeared from the city when the rituals were completed.

The people started to obey blindly these new figures, who began to spread that they were witches of the [[Abyss]]. Many even helped the hags to invade the city fortress and throw out the guard and the employees. Thus they settled there, along with their most loyal servants. The new administration of the city was appointed and controlled by them. 

The [[700 Days of Shadow|two years of Shadow]] passed but the tyrannical regime in the city did not change. The sacrifices continued and even more power passed to the three crones. Soon the city became repulsive for many merchants, but for others it became an opportunity. Within this strict framework there were no serious laws that restricted ship arrivals, apart from some customs. Thus, several pirates and fugitives added the city to their possible destinations, but no one wanted to go and settle there permanently.
