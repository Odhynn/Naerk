The great capital of Green Hills. It is surrounded by numerous fertile plains and hills and has three immense towers constructed in a triangle: one for [[Laerion]], his knights and [[Luminous Sword]], one for [[Factar]], his clergy and [[Luminous Order]] and one for the king. They reach six hundred feet in height, and are seen from a great distance on the [[Green Hills]]. They communicate with each other with three bridges. The city contains a huge library filled with ancient archives of ages past that is tended by numerous scolars.

## History

Ostrabit has faced numerous sieges over the years, most notably during 4632 against [[Paraselt]] monsters.
