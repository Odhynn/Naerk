A vast pirate port and refuge full of unrully crews. It is where the [[Pirate Council]] takes place.

## History

Originally a fortified outpost founded by [[Qurin]] and general [[Duarte]] during the [[First Zelgerosh Expedition]], the second quickly took over and expelled all those not loyal to him. He started attacking merchant convoys and eventually turned to piracy. The settlement quickly became a pirate refuge, the name originated from the plunder that arrived in town, waiting to be spent or deposited.
