## Description

A unique city in [[Veth Spikes]] that draws power from the crystals of [[Veth]] to create unique magical effects. It is an arcane metropolis full of wizards, Vethfolk, academies and magic practicioners. Almost all movement between the flying buildings was done by flying griffons and drawbridges. There was endless food and drink, teleporting gates, swarms of magical creatures, age-old wizards, and many other magical effects of similar scope.

## History

Xe'Farom's expansionist policy and [[Maenorian]]'s presence disturbed many gods and higher beings, but had given no cause for any of them to intervene. Unfortunately, in the year -1039  a unique [[Astral Alignment]] occured. This gave immense power to the inhabitants of the city and the events caused by this newfound power threatened the very existence of time and space and provoked [[Yerastu]]'s intervention on Maeronian, with the city ready to crumble.

So, he decided to make a proposal to the Vethian captive. If he chose to share his magical powers with Sumril, she would free him and allow him to join the pantheon, oblivious to being a Vethian and his past transgressions. But he made it an additional condition that the use of this kind of magic would be severely curtailed, and that together with Sumril they would have to curtail abusers, starting with Xe'Farom.

Maeronian accepted, and now together with Sumril are responsible for managing and controlling all magic, its users and Veth's radiation, as well as any unforeseen events. As a condition of agreeing, Maeronian stipulated that Yerasthu would not punish Xe'Farom and its inhabitants if they limited their magical effects to the original data, and so it was. Since then, Sumril was able to very effectively control whenever any abuse was made and curtail it, while Xe'Farom significantly limited the use of magic, and both gods placed an invisibility cloak around the city and Naerk, which filters what properties emitted magic can provide, limiting magic that affects spacetime. Eventually [[Maeronian]] guaranteed the safety of the city.
