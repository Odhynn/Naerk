It is so far unknown exactly when Eltirion ("star tower") was built in the highest mountains in the center of the continent, but a fair guess would place it at -2000 to -1600. The complex built there by the elves connected projectively to the Cosmodrome in such a way that it functioned as a gateway to other worlds.

As the millennia passed, in the shadow of Eltirion the civilization of Selanaar developed, consisting of a multi-racial multi-class system (elf, dwarf, human, gnome races / noble, mage, warrior, merchant, artisan, sailor, farmer, herder castes).
Throughout, the elves maintained a leading role until a terrible internal crisis took place in the late 17th century. What exactly happened is unfortunately difficult to ascertain, as already the population of Selanaar was characteristically aloof and secretive to the outside world.

The most reliable information recorded by [[Imtaria]] merchants was a local rumor that "the elves were to blame". The most stable scenario points to some kind of dramatic development within or because of Eltirion, as the crisis ended with the dwarves quarantining it. Thus the dwarves found themselves at the helm of the kingdom of Selanaar (pronounced [[Selanahr]]) for the next 1500 years while the elves gradually disappeared.

In the wake of the [[Winter's War]] in the early 3260s, the nation of [[Selanahr]] suddenly stopped interacting with the Northern Lands. The seas around Athalaar had grown wild and raged unceasingly. Those who attempted to venture beyond the southeastern archipelago of [[Alagon]] to see what happened inland never returned, while the inhabitants of the archipelago themselves (made up largely of former pirate states) whispered tales of sights and monsters. Selanahr's second inner crisis must have been the revelation that wiped it off the cultural map and created the [[Harrowlands]] phenomenon.
