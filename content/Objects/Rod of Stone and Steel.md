## Creation

In ancient times, the [[Vethians]] sought to explore the limits of their power. As descendants of [[Veth]], they were innately inclined towards magic and could in fact very easily tame it and produce unique and powerful effects. But, as they are by nature unpredictable and have no specific moral code, in many experiments that they performed and in various of their creations and discoveries, their consequences could not be foreseen from the beginning, and many spells and objects derived from them are even today a source of desire, fear and awe for many.

One of the most powerful Vethians, also known as [[Rhekvethor]], is also the creator of the Rod of Stone and Steel. Rhekvethor, a being of unimaginable power and a friend of [[Maeronian]], the god of magic, loved to travel to the most distant places and dimensions. Obviously, he wasn't well-received everywhere and was constantly changing his form, a skill he was particularly good at. He gathered knowledge and experience from many places, while befriending various powerful wizards and creatures from other dimensions in his many wanderings. And one day Rhekvethor set a goal in his life.

His dream was to be able to control the element of earth, specifically stone, minerals, metals and subsoil. To be able to make whatever he wants from these materials in colossal scale. And so he spent an infinite amount of time, using all his resources and experiences to make a scepter that would allow him to accomplish his goal.

Obviously, even for him, such a process was not simple. The materials, the construction and the ritual, each stage, required a lot of time and effort. First, he asked the gnomes who lived in [[Kelzadam]] and were craftsmen in stone, to make 5 [[Varyads]] for the hilt: Precious stones derived from Larvite, a rock from the bowels of the earth. Some very specific types of Mithril and Adamantine, infused with Veth's own blood, had to be added to the construction of the head. Rhekvethor, to construct the scepter, enlisted the help of three of his friends: [[Salkor]], [[Tavethir]], and [[Bodrig]].

The master craftsman, who carved the shape of the scepter, was the latter: an extraterrestrial from Kelzadam, who settled near volcanoes and the [[Deeps]]. Bodrig had a great reputation, for he had forged some of the finest weapons, such as the [[Shiji-sha]] katana. But Bodrig, in order to increase the scepter's power, added to the skeleton a bone from [[Ashatai]], an old friend of his who had become an angel from his deeds. What's worse, 2 scrolls stolen from a powerful wizard of the [[Lords of the Will]] were required during assembly. So even though they kept its creation a secret, they made a lot of enemies to build it.

[[Salkor]] then took the reins with Tavethir. The former, a young but promising [[Vethians|Vethian]] full of vivaciousness and curiosity, and the latter a renowned elf, warrior and craftsman. But the second, loyal to [[Yerastu]], did not learn all the details of the construction, because the others did not trust him, and there was a danger that he would betray them if he did possess the knowledge. The two of them carved the runes on the scepter in three languages: Ancient, Vethian and Terran. They then cast various magic spells, which combined the individual materials and gave the scepter its basic properties.

The scepter was then taken by Salkor, where he had to find his main source of power to make it work. His research led him to an ancient, deep cave, where there was a diamond that constantly vibrated with power. It was a point where countless [[Tarov]]'s [[Leylines]] passed, and it had gained immense power underground. But there was one major problem: This diamond could not be cut out of place by any means. Salkor then begged the titan [[Dumspergrond]] to help him. This titan had a huge hammer, which he called [[Earthquake]], precisely because it created seismic vibrations when he struck it. The titan apparently thought he would get the diamond for himself, so he accepted.

With his hammer he struck the diamond with all his might. The diamond was cut from the rock, releasing incredible energy and destabilizing the entire mountain. A huge earthquake immediately followed, cutting the [[Tarhelm]] mountain range in two, destroying countless orc and dwarven settlements on the mountain, and creating a huge chasm across the mountains. This destruction enraged [[Tarov]], who cursed Dumspergrond to never see the light of the sun again and be forever trapped on earth. Salkor had of course taken the diamond and disappeared. Try as Tarov might, she couldn't find out what happened to the diamond when she realized the titan didn't have it.

The final stage of creation was the ceremony that would incorporate the diamond into the scepter. Rhekvethor paid great attention to every last detail and recited ancient words of power in the runic tongue, and created a hot silver dust of magic, which the scepter greedily swallowed and joined with the diamond.

This is how the Rod of Stone and Steel came to be.

## [[Unnamed Judgement]]

The unethical (to some) acts that Rhekvethor had to do to create the rod piqued the interest of many creatures, and they began to track his movements. Rhekvethor realized a major drawback of the rod: it could not leave Na'erk in other dimensions. This, though it troubled him, by no means prevented him from using it. He built Strumeld, a huge fortress of metal, as well as an underground labyrinth beneath it, and filled it all with silver sentry constructs. He then built a huge bridge, connecting the two sides of Roflar's strait, to create the future cities of Sapurr and Flair at its ends.

Many had already been disturbed by his actions, but when Rhekvethor began to build a huge stone colossus, the glass overflowed. The servants of Sigard, Yerastu, and Laerion found him while he was finishing the colossus and attacked him while he was busy with the ceremony. His associates, Tavethir and Salkor, tried in vain to stop them, and eventually captured all three. After a short talk, the servants of the gods of justice decided to judge them.

The trial that followed was called the Unnamed Judgment. As everyone involved there did not want anything to be known about Rod's immense power, they made sure that it was not kept practical and that no one else would learn of the events that took place there. Judges took charge of nine creatures. Four Archangels: Lo Ukmasid, Lu Peng, La Vermenel and Li Tithlamir. Three priests, one for each god, of whom the famous Hikari was the high priest of Yerastu. And two dragons, the brass Hrondoshel and a blue one, which remains unknown.

Tavethir was called first to confess his actions. Although initially hesitant, he eventually recounted the full timeline of events, leaving no doubt as to his truthfulness, incurring the wrath of Salkor and Rhekvethor. The two were summarily sentenced, and imprisoned in the bowels of the earth, with the help of the crystal dragon Menthdravor, who took over as their guardian. Rhekvethor was decided to be too dangerous to leave, and they decided to imprison him forever: As for Salkor, they decided to imprison him for five centuries, as he was not that dangerous in their eyes. Since then, those who learned about the trial have felt that it lacked objectivity, although some see this as reasonable given the circumstances.

The Moaning Diamond was detached from the rod and given to a tribe of Tarov subterranean creatures for safekeeping, while the rod was in a dimension that communicated only with the Tartars, in a deep place with a constant whirlwind protecting it. Tavethir was assigned to guard the only passage leading there from the material dimension, as a chance to atone for his actions, cursed to an eternity of duty. Finally, the four angels set their rings to be a key to the rod: so that even if someone passed through it, he could not use it. And the rings were given to the four corners of the horizon, in safe hands. As the millennia passed, everyone forgot about these events, and the few who knew the truth became fewer.
