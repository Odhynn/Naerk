## Creation

In ancient times, the Vethians sought to explore the limits of their power. As descendants of the Veth, they were innately inclined towards magic and could in fact very easily tame it and produce unique and powerful effects. But, as they are by nature unpredictable and have no specific moral code, in many experiments they performed and in various of their creations and discoveries, their consequences could not be foreseen from the beginning, and many spells and objects derived from they are even today a source of desire, fear and awe for many.

One of the most powerful Vethians, also known as Rhekvethor, is also the creator of the Rod of Stone and Steel. Rhekvethor, being a being of unimaginable power and a friend of Maeronian, the god of magic, loved to travel to the most distant places and dimensions. Obviously, he wasn't well-received everywhere and was constantly changing his form, a skill he was particularly good at. He gathered knowledge and experience from many places, while befriending various powerful wizards and creatures from other dimensions in his many wanderings. And one day Rhekvethor set a goal in his life.

His dream was to be able to control the element of earth, specifically stone, minerals, metals and subsoil. To be able to make whatever he wants from these materials in colossal sizes. And so he spent an infinite amount of time, using all his resources and experiences to make a scepter that would allow him to accomplish his goal.

Obviously, even for him, such a process was not simple. The materials, the construction and the ritual, each stage, required a lot of time and effort. First, he asked the gnomes who lived in Kelzadam and were craftsmen in stone, to make 5 Varyads for the hilt: Precious stones derived from Larvite, a rock from the bowels of the earth. Some very specific types of Mithril and Adamantine, infused with Veth's own blood, had to be added to the construction of the head. Rhekvethor, to construct the scepter, enlisted the help of three of his friends: Salkor, Tavethir, and Bodrig.

The master craftsman, who carved the shape of the scepter, was the latter: an extraterrestrial from Kelzadam, who frequented volcanoes and the Deeps. Bodrig had a great reputation, for he had forged some of the finest weapons, such as the Shiji-sha katana. But Bodrig, in order to increase the scepter's power, added to the skeleton a bone from Ashatai, an old friend of his who had become an angel by his exploits. What's more, 2 scrolls stolen from a powerful wizard of the Lords of the Will were required during assembly. So even though they kept its creation a secret, they made a lot of enemies to build it.

Salkor then took the reins with Tavethir. The former, a young but promising Vethian full of vivaciousness and worry, and the latter a renowned elf, warrior and craftsman. But the second, loyal to Yerastu, did not learn all the details of the construction, because the others did not trust him, and there was a danger that he would betray them if he did. The two of them carved the runes on the scepter in three dialects: Ancient, Vethian and Terran. They then cast various magic spells, which combined the individual materials and gave the scepter its basic capabilities.

The scepter was then taken by Salkor, where he had to find his main source of power to make it work. His research led him to an ancient, deep cave, where there was a diamond that constantly vibrated with power. It was a point where countless Tarov's Ley Lines passed, and it had gained immense power underground. But there was one major problem: This diamond could not be cut out of place by any means. Salkor then begged the titan Dumspergrond to help him. This titan had a huge hammer, which he called Earthquake, precisely because it created seismic vibrations when he struck it. The titan apparently thought he would get the diamond for himself, so he accepted.

With his hammer he struck the diamond with all his might. The diamond was cut from the rock, releasing incredible energy and destabilizing the entire mountain. A huge earthquake immediately followed, cutting the Tarhelm mountain range in two, destroying countless orc and dwarven settlements on the mountain, and creating a huge chasm across the mountains. This destruction enraged Tarov, who cursed Dumspergrond to never see the light of the sun again and be forever trapped on earth. Salkor had of course taken the diamond and disappeared. Try as Tarov might, she couldn't find out what happened to the diamond when she realized the titan didn't have it.

The final stage of creation was the ceremony that would incorporate the diamond into the scepter. Rhekvethor paid great attention to every last detail and recited ancient words of power in the runic tongue, and created a hot silver dust of magic, which the scepter greedily swallowed and joined with the diamond.

This is how the Rod of Stone and Steel came to be.
