This curved sword was forged by [[Thori-Rakkam|Klont]] by mercury from the time of the [[Primordial War]], when the four [[Elemental Lords]] had joined forces. It could change size and use all four elements at once with each hit, to deadly effect. It was given to [[Ashiro]] during [[Winter's War]].
