Powerful crystalic formations that are affiliated to [[Veth]] magic. They can magnify magic effects and spells, and are mostly found as powder for spell components. The solid crystals are rare and desired by all spellcasters, as they give immense power to their wielder. They are believed to be in [[Veth Spikes]] and one of these was used during the [[Winter's War]].
