A red diamond that was unstable and made vibrations from the moment the titan [[Dumspergrond]] pulled it out from the mountain with [[Earthquake]]. It was inserted by [[Bodrig]] into the [[Rod of Stone and Steel]]. After the [[Unnamed Judgement]] where the rod was disassembled, the diamond was given back to the titan [[Dumspergrond]] and imprisoned him in [[Str√ºmeld]].
