[[Klont]] crafted 40 sets of dwarven armor and weapons, custom made for the [[Winter's War]]. Made of a unique type of brass that came from the Sun, they shone like daylight and tore through the darkness, while combined with the dwarven shields, made of an ancient type of glass, made each wielder a veteran and elite dwarven warrior and moving fort. For weapons he made them axes made of [[Veth]]'s own blood, weapons that shattered the defenses of the Winterwights. Some sets of these weapons and armor are rumored to still exist in Talhad or Embergrond, but the dwarves keep their secrets well hidden.
