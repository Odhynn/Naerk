[[Sergonial]]'s most loyal warlords and servants took these scrolls with his laws, the so-called Scrolls of the Supreme Tyrant, by whose help they organized their armies and increased their influence in the [[Material Plane]]. With these scrolls, contracts with mortals could be made, giving them power in exchange of their soul in afterlife to serve in [[Hell]] eternally.
