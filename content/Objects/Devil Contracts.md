## History

Sergonial visited Orgonol and told him _“Now that we don't have unlimited souls, we must secure our access to them, as it is the only way to ensure that there will be other devils in the future. How do you think we should manage it?"_

_“We want to make a better world right? We can ask the souls themselves who want the same to help us. It will be like making their dream come true, in exchange for them helping us to do it together. I'm sure this will be a deal they can't refuse. It's not a big problem that we can't go to Styx to ask them. We can go to the material dimension, where the rules of Yerastu are heard only by those who want to. I'm sure many will agree to help us build a better world."_ Orgonol replied looking Sergonial in the eye.

Sergonial smiled and left saying _“We will make one soul's dream come true if she in turn gives her existence to the cause. This is indeed a deal he won't be able to refuse."_ On the very same day, Sergonial commissioned his most suitable agents to go into the [[Material Plane]] and make anyone's wishes come true, in exchange for him giving them his soul upon his death.

These agreements were called The Devil Contracts. With them, mortals are granted power and assistance in life, but are destined for eternal service in [[Hell]] at afterlife. Over the centuries, the souls were treaded progressively worse, to the point that caused [[Orgonol's Insurrection]].
