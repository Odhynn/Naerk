A creation of the [[Gatewatch]] wizards of [[Lengoth]]: a magical construct that could detect dimensional anomalies through magic abuse or instances where summoning magic is being misused. In most cases, there was a huge difference between learning about the incident within minutes and within hours and that was the main reason to create this construct. About the size of a sparrow, hundreds of these creatures were made and spread to the major cities around the [[Misty Sea]]. They were made to be able to travel indefinitely in the [[Styx]], the river of souls, and therefore can detect when someone goes to cross the veil to pass into the [[Material Plane]].

Another ability given to the Virryldians, is when they gather in numbers of five or more to create a temporary Portal, which can instantly teleport [[Lengoth]] wizards to where the Virryldians are. This ability was often used to transport magicians to the places where their intervention was needed. However, this ability of theirs also had unforeseen consequences such as the [[Ol-Girrot Incident]].
