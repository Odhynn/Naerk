After the [[Unnamed Judgement]] concluded, the four celestial angels, [[Li-Tithlamir]], [[La-Vermenel]], [[Lo-Ukmasid]] and [[Lu-Peng]] used their Solarium rings into the [[Rod of Stone and Steel]] to prevent its usage. The only possible way for the Rod to be reused was for the four rings to be refitted into the rod's handle.
