## Description

An artifact that had the ability to copy the magic of any other object and be able to call upon its power at a later point in time. The greater the power of this, the less time it could be utilised.

## Omniverse Tower Incident

It was used by an ambitious circle of wizards that tried to rival the gods, causing the [[Omniverse Tower Incident]]. They modified the artifact to be able to copy multiple objects at once and managed to copy the [[Malgyra]] undetected after intelligence gathering and espionage. After the Malgyra were scattered on the [[Elemental Ring]], the Sphere was destroyed by [[Yerastu]] as retaliation, together with the wizards responsible.
