A creation of the [[Gatewatch]] wizards of [[Lengoth]] after the [[Ol-Girrot Incident]]. These are constructs like [[Virryldians]] with a greater range and field of detection, and can be much more difficult to spot. Only certain magical items can control them, items that are directly controlled by their creators themselves. The main purpose of the Varyas is to identify Virryldians that are under third-party control or damaged, before they are used in any way that goes against their purpose.
