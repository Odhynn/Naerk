A giant adamantine hammer that was wielded by [[Dumspergrond]]. It is said it was build by himself in ages unknown, and as the name suggests, it created a literal small scale earthquake upon hitting the ground. After his death, it lies in the streets of [[Ekteron]] where it fell, with nobody able to move the artifact away.
