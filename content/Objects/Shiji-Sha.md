>The form of the extraplanal creature seemed to destabilize. Thin blue lines began to leave his blurred form and fly in every direction. As they passed, up close they seemed not to be lines.

>A single beam with a hum fell on Shiji. A thin line ran along the length of the sword, and it glowed with the same blue color.
>And at the base of the weapon's blade, a third letter appeared, in perfect symmetry with the other two, as if it had been carved there all along, to complete the song of the other two.
