>The form of the extraplanal creature seemed to destabilize. Thin blue lines began to leave his blurred form and fly in every direction. As they passed, up close they seemed not to be lines. They were words, letters, images, sounds, tastes and smells. The knowledge of centuries. Wars, arts, music, experiences, dialogues, all seemed to fly and disappear in every direction.

> This old and simple yet finely crafted and combat-ready solanian truesteel blade bears its name engraved in kanji close to the guard and shines with a silvery gleam. The hilt features a circular dragon bronze tsuba, a burgundy braided samé ray skin grip and a bronze menuki. The sword is sheathed in a deep blue lacquered maple scabbard.

Shiji-Sha (支持者) the Upholder was a legendary blade crafted for the legendary champion [[Hikari]] Kashiwa in Naerk, and returned to shape the fate of Naerk at the hands of his descendant, [[Shizu]] the Swordmaiden.
Eventually it was passed on to Hikari's progeny, who carried it with them across the astral portals in the Realms Beyond to Hikari's heartland of Yuuyami.  

This katana was intelligent and infused with the spirit of honour and valour; as such, it chose its wielder, not the other way around. Though it was bequeathed for millenia down along the proud Kashiwa line, it only awoke to but a few of its wielders; for everyone not deemed worthy, it was but a plain katana.

Shizu's grandfather Heisuke Kashiwa passed the blade to her with his dying breath. Fully awoken to Shizu following her great deeds, Shiji-sha saw her through all the exploits of the [[Band of Blood and Brimstone]].

It is now carried by Lady Hime Kashiwa of the Sennarii Clans of Snow, given to her by her older sister Shizu before the events of [[Sennarin#the Arrival]], so that it may continue watching over the Kashiwa line.
