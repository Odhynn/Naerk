These legendary diamonds were given by the [[Equalizer]] to the [[Elemental Lords]] to ensure that each of them could have absolute power with their element, but at the same time would limit them from interfering in the [[Material Plane]] and from taking advantage of others. These were sealed by the lords and became known as [[Malgyra]]. Before retiring, the Equalizer made it clear that the safekeeping of these items is particularly important, and disclaimed his responsibility.

For several millennia there was no particular disturbance in this balance. No one seemed to be able to disturb her, even after the creation of the [[Rod of Stone and Steel]]. However, the [[Winter's War]], in the year 3250, the massive aftermath of the Battle of [[Fallfaunt]] and the reemergence of the [[Eye of Veth]] brought the power play of the four elements back to the table, with the future of all of [[Naerk]] at stake. The attempt by Fyrlean, the fire lord, to take the other three artifacts, to dominate the others and the material dimension, led to a battle of immense proportions that took place mainly in the Elemental Ring.

According to [[Chandor]], who was present there, without [[Ashiro]]'s intervention the outcome of this would have been disastrous. But now, few know about this battle, and even fewer are willing to recount it.
