A magical helmet in [[South Darrok]] kept in [[Queenswood]]. It had been made in Ekteron with metal from the river [[Styx]] and whoever wore it could read thoughts and even predict the future. It is said that it was made by the wizards of [[Wyrsaliir]] in ancient times and had been washed up by the river [[Serpent's Tail]] in [[Sapurr]].

[[King Laorwick Î™]] sent spies of the [[Crimson Steel]] to [[Llykavann]] during the [[Decade War of Arbader and South Darrok]] and they stole it at the beginning of the invasion. They fled and handed the helmet to the king. He used it to gaind several tactical advantages on the war.
