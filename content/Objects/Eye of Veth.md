A powerful artifact of [[Veth]], aged from [[Primordial War]]. It acted as a magnifying lens to any source of magic. When a magical effect reached the eye, it was multiplied many times over, creating a much more potent result. It was used by the witch [[Tayra]] in the [[Winter's War]] to freeze [[Naerk]] by channeling [[Fallfaunt]]'s essence.
