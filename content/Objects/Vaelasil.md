This powerful crystal orb, also known as Orb of Corruption, was given by [[Voolthow]] to [[King Erlamin]]. It is the strongest artifact made by [[Voolthow]] at his first attempt to try and corrupt the [[Material Plane]] and the powerful civilization of the [[Edhellin]]. Within a century the orb started to spread its influence among the elves causing warmongering and hierarchy struggles as the start of the demise of the elves. The corruption of the king ultimatelly caused [[Sylris]]' exile.
