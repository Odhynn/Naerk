## Origin

As [[Malahir]] in the ancient years began to spread her influence into the [[Material Plane]], she found that space did not continue there the same way it did in the [[Evergrowing Forest]]. Animals, [[Aspects]], and fey came and went on the loosely certain borders of the two dimensions, but often from adjacent locations of the Evergrowing Forest they ended up in completely different ones on the Material Plane.

## Thorny Passage

This gradually became more predictable as the seasons and climate stabilized. From a warm or tropical point of the Evergrowing Forest one ended up in a corresponding tropical forest near the Equator, and respectively for temperate and polar regions. The [[Aspects]], most fey, and animals were not interested for these transitions, and often changed dimensions without realizing it: But other creatures soon appeared, such as druids, satyrs, and other malevolent fey of cunning or murderous intent. When they began to discover all these passages, they soon began to come and go unmolested: Often for refuge in the Evergrowing Forest, and then to do their dirty work in whatever part of the Material Plane they could access. There were cases of murderers and robbers who within a month had multiple victims in [[Zelgerosh]], [[Markesh]] and [[Ngamui Isles]] and left unmolested.

Several druids realized that the actions of these irresponsible criminals endangered the entire natural balance. Eventually one of them, a pitch black fey known as [[Maer'mora]]. A victim of betrayal by his own kind, he was a charred creature that started fires in both the [[Material Plane]] and the Evergrowing Forest. But when the druids came to deal with it, he eluded them: and even worse, he gradually managed to gather other persecutors to his side: they soon became known as the [[Thorny Passage]].

The [[druid]] circles almost unanimously began to resist the Thorny Passage, but in most battles they simply slipped away. Then, [[Oliven]], one of the senior druids, suggested that they find all the portals and seal them, because only in this way could the evil be contained. Thus, druids and rangers, with the help of [[Sylvanaya|Vel Rezal]] trees and elves, found most of the portals one by one: In tree trunks, in lakes, in oases, in caves and in roots. Some they closed permanently, some they sealed, and in some they appointed protectors or guardians from the natural world or from the younger races of men or gnomes.

## After Vethfall

These portals came to the fore again after the [[Vethfall]]. Traditional magical ways of teleportation and dimensional change began to fail, making the portals' value enormous. Accordingly, the Thorny Passage, who had survived and been forgotten, resumed tormenting travelers and gaining power from the few portals they had in hidden places under their control.
