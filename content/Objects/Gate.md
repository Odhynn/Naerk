A magical passage that connects two different places and teleports creatures from one area to the other, ignoring the boundaries of distance or even [[Planes]]. Most Gates are well-guarded and their location or even existence is a secret to most. Many Gates were rendered malfunctioning or were even destroyed during [[Vethfall]], as a result of the widespread alteration of how [[Veth]] magic works.
