The [[Hithlen]] people, unlike the other tribes in the west, had a constant population growth and development. This was mainly because they had developed their agriculture. All the lands half the length of the [[River Ilmen]] were fertile plains, and they were sown everywhere. From the early years of Hithlwin's founding in 4363, the Hithlen senate was the highest body in the land. This was at the same time the only factor that could guarantee its prosperity and stability, at a time when the various regions wanted a greater share in the exercise of power. For their protection, they founded a special monastery, also known as [[Balaruna Fortress]], in which a special unit of warriors, the [[Swords of Balaruna]], began to be trained hard from babies. The [[Hithlen]] also built their capital on the river bank, and named it [[Elmatassi]], the diamond of the river.

[[Elmatassi]] was a city that was constantly growing, as was the wealth of the country. Watermills and windmills were built  throughout the country, which soon took the name Hithlwin. Cattle and mules plowed the land daily, continuously feeding the growing needs of the inhabitants. However, eventually Hithlwin's expansion reached the western jungles, with the natives viewing the Hithlen with hostility. Hithlwin began to fight them and cut down the forests, to expand their crops, and since they had many more warriors, they could easily bend the resistance of the other tribes and drive them from their territories. Many refugees sought refuge in [[Tithlon]], where they were accepted.

A few months later, while Hithlwin's warriors had entered the forest for good, something unexpected happened. The volcano of [[Kegrozal]] in Paraselt erupted, throwing a huge amount of volcanic ash, lava and magma in all directions. The winds carried most of the hot blast to the east, causing most of the jungle to be destroyed and incinerated. This was the end for most of the forest tribes. Those who managed escaped to Tithlon or the southern coast, while the area was flattened.

Two years later, the Hithlen re-entered what was left of the jungle, this time without resistance. The ash proved particularly fertile for their fields, and over the next few years the charred forest was rapidly converted to crops. The Hithlen tamed elephants from the south, fortified their borders in the north, and divided the land among the entire population to cultivate. Since then, Hithlwin has been on a steady course of prosperity. Its enemies are now the elves of [[Naryal]] and the orcs of [[Crol'gosh]], but on the open plains of the south its army is unquestionably invincible, now numbering two million regular and irregular warriors, along with hundreds of elephants.

As for its cities, they include buildings, monuments and constructions of unimaginable architecture. Marble and ivory columns tens of yards in height, bridges over a mile long, arches, pyramids, towers and aqueducts complete a unique picture of Hithlwin's power. No one can question its power, and all tremble at the mere thought that the senate, their highest body, may one day decide to invade a neighboring country. The difficulty of carrying out that decision according to many sages is about the same as the difficulty of making it.
