## Origins

The island of [[Zolkar]] is one of the most cosmopolitan places Inner sea. Much of the population comes from [[South Darrok]], that migrated for economic reasons or for safety from attacks of the North. Many more came from [[Imtaria]], merchants and sailors that took advantage of its strategic geographical position. Many sailors knew there would always be a ship asking for a helping hand, while the merchants could, by virtue of the [[Palaurim|treaty]], trade undisturbed throughout its gulf Zolkar's Dawn. The finfolk are also very common, since their island Corralion is next door. Finally, rich farmers from [[Oromil]] come from south for bargains or slaves. Although one of the most famous commercial destinations, the island could never come completely under her authority Imtaria.

## Spiked Shackles Riot

Zolkar was in recent turmoil as [[Zolkar's Dawn Riot|a riot]] took place that shook the very foundations of the island. The rioters entered politics after a ceasefire and reformed all former things, including its laws, its ruling class and slave trade. Nevertheless, today there are still quite a few slaves on the island, limited to less than a dozen big slave traders who move the threads in secret. The situation in the city is still unstable.

## Relations

Zolkar currently has two councelor seats in [[Palaurim]], one held by [[Steelshade]]. Imtaria monitors closely the unstable political situation in the country but has not yet taken any side.
