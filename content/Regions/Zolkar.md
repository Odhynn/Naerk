## Origins

The island of [[Zolkar]] is one of the most cosmopolitan places Inner sea. Much of the population comes from [[South Darrok]], that migrated for economic reasons or for safety from attacks of the North. Many more came from [[Imtaria]], merchants and sailors that took advantage of its strategic geographical position. Many sailors knew there would always be a ship asking for a helping hand, while the merchants could, by virtue of the [[Palaurim|treaty]], trade undisturbed throughout its gulf Zolkar's Dawn. The finfolk are also very common, since their island Corralion is next door. Finally, rich farmers from [[Oromil]] come from the south for bargains and slaves. Although one of the most famous commercial destinations, the island could never come completely under the authority of Imtaria.

## Spiked Shackles Riot

Zolkar most recent turmoil happened during the [[Zolkar's Dawn Riot|a riot]], which that shook the very foundations of the island. The rioters, led by the [[Berenfaer]], entered the political sphere after a ceasefire and reformed all its social infrastructure, including its laws, its ruling class and the slave trade. Nevertheless, today there are still quite a few slaves on the island, limited to less than a dozen big slave traders who move the threads in secret. The situation in Elestair is still unstable.

## Relations

Zolkar currently has two councillor seats in [[Palaurim]], one held by Berenfaer spymaster [[Steelshade]]. Imtaria monitors closely the unstable political situation in the country but has not yet taken any side.
