## The merchants' paradise

For many, Arbader is literally the evil face of Imtaria. For this fertile land, rumor has it that if someone had to choose between one's life and one's money, he would choose the latter. Human greed and avarice are, if nothing else, mythical. Arbader joined [[Palaurim]] at its formation and currently has 13 councelors.

But things were not always like this. Originally the country had peaceful and hospitable inhabitants and a particularly good king known as [[King Laorwick II|Laorwick II]]. In the middle of the last century, Arbader faced invasions from monsters on its northern borders that came from the swamps south of [[Zunomar]]. Laorwick, heir to the throne at the time, had gathered some brave warriors and with several losses was able to repel the attacks. The warriors who followed him into battle were called Brownswords, from their swamp-stained weapons, and once he returned in triumph, they became his personal guard until the day he became king, two years later.

During the reign of Laorwick, Arbader flourished like never before. In each city, the king had installed his own warriors and wizards who could implement his decisions, and the whole country was safe. Watermills and windmills, roads throughout the territory, as well as aqueducts were built with a special fund. Laorwick took advantage of the [[Palaurim]] treaty to increase the country's exports, and soon food and drink from the fertile lands of Arbader was found in common throughout the inner sea.

Twenty years later, the situation changed dramatically. The [[Crimson Steel]] came into the area, and began murdering all of Laorwick's advisors, friends, and fellow warriors one by one, starting from the most distant cities and ending in the capital of [[Hashnev]]. Gradually the king's power was diminished, and many appeared who questioned his decisions. At a public trial of some murderers destined for hanging, the Crimson Steel made their move. They attacked the Brownswords with poisoned arrows and murdered the king, wreaking havoc on the city.

For six months, chaos reigned in the region. Bandits roamed free and stole whatever they could find, while murders and rapes were on a daily basis. The king's laws were no longer of any value, and the garrison was disorganized, as were the remaining Brownswords. Until one day, a villager found a nugget of gold in river [[Fenor]] north of the capital.

The news about the gold spread all over the country within a few days. Hordes of commonfolk flocked to that spot to make their fortunes, and many began to quarrel over matters of property in brawls that ended in injuries and deaths. Soon the area was distributed by the Brownswords to a few traders and artisans, who recruited people to their work extracting gold. The untold riches they amassed enabled them to hire mercenaries to protect them, and they eventually gained control of the entire city and region. They gradually spread throughout the country, where now a few families are in command with a council ruled by the eleven most powerful aristocrats. The Crimson Steel have limited their action as the countries of Palaurim sent reinforcements to safeguard the gold that would eventually end up in their hands (mainly [[Imtaria]]) while in a short time, Arbader's mercenary army grew in size and was able to contain the action of criminals; except those able to bribe high enough.

Corruption grew as various noble circles seemed to take more and more power into their own hands. The wealthiest of them, a nobleman named [[King Oodas|Oodas Bildarion]], took power. Soon after, as if waiting for the right moment, a number of things in [[Hashnev]] changed. Sergonial's temple was fortified under High Priest [[Black Alkar|Alkar the Black]], the slave market in the city multiplied, the arena tripled its gladiators, bugbears ghettoized the city, and crime multiplied, with the guard often whistling nonchalantly.
