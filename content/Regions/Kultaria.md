## Origin

The Hidden Kingdom of [[Nahantaria]] eventually over the centuries became powerful enough so that it could emerge from hiding. Its king, in a spectacular ceremony calld Luksi, he declared the formation of the High Kingdom of Kultaria.

## Description

Kultaria was in the region of today's [[Imtaria]]. It was the first and biggest kingdom of man, and boasted amazing technological and magical developments. It could amass a huge army, aqueducts and canals among hundreds of miles, and the palace of Vaedar was a sight to behold. Even the lowliest soldier could afford to possess magical armaments and the ships were made with gems and pearls. Its libraries were full of arcane and historical texts of all subjects known to man.

## Downfall

Kultaria declined after [[Winter's War]] and was ravaged by a mass-scale civil war of ascension, known as [[Brothers War]]. After this war, that lasted almost a decade, the remnants of the country were incorporated into the new [[Imtaria]] empire and governed by the victorious [[Emperor Zuria]] "The True" Kaldun.
