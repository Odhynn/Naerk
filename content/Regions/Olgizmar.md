## History

Four centuries ago, the peninsula east of Darrok was called Almahr and was one of the wealthiest regions in the Inner Sea. Its success was partly due to its geographical position, which made it a trading center between [[Korhond]], Northern [[Darrok]] and [[Imtaria]]. Unfortunately, on this region was a guild of powerful wizards, also known as [[Demonslavers]], who had absolute control over power and the distribution of goods and also summoned [[demons]].

Almahr quickly expanded westward with their demon armies. But [[Darrok]] saw the threat and responded in time. Many of his brave warriors were sacrificed in the first battles, so that the dwarves could build fortresses in several places that would limit the expansion of [[demons]] and wizards, among them [[Khalaram]] and [[Keyrod]]. At the same time, sensing the threat, Imtaria sent a fleet to limit Almahr's naval power to the south. At last, with many casualties, after two years of warfare, the wizards halted their advance and changed their plan.

## Demon Outbreak

After a lengthy council, the archwizards decided to turn to their greatest power, magic. They began to sacrifice anyone who was expendable to them to get revenge, and soon the demon army doubled in size. What they didn't know, however, was that the demons were dangerous to them as well. Thus they answered the call without recompense from moment to moment, and passed en masse through the Gates into the material dimension. One day in 4529, the demons broke the seals that kept them enslaved by the wizards and attacked their masters, in a month-long bloodbath. Almahr was then renamed Olgizmar, the black wasteland. The demons tried to expand north, but when the wizards stopped them with magic wards, they attacked [[Darrok]]. The resulting [[Bloodline War|war and events]] made Olgizmar an off-limit island.

The wizards, however, were strong enough to hold in some areas, such as the capital city of [[Dorvolosh]]. Also, once the seals were broken, many demons found that they could not stay in the material dimension for long. At the same time, however, some Gates remained open, and operated in a limited manner. So today there is a very strange situation in the area, where magicians and demons coexist, and in each area some are masters and some are slaves.

The southern part of the island, centered on [[Pyrlon]], has been dominated by [[demons]], and rumor has it that they have at least one gateway to and from the Abyss. The woods are dark and mysterious to the southeast, as the influence of demons is strong, and the place resembles an Abyss. It is ruled by the [[Vile Septet]], seven demon lords each with his own territory. Accordingly, in the northwest mages have been able to limit the expansion of the demons, and have filled the area near Dorvolosh with protective runes and spells that keep the demons at bay. At the same time, in Gatewatch there is a lair of wizards, who try to keep the demons at bay, but they receive many raids. It is where the island's largest gate is located, and it is vital to the Demonslavers that the demons do not take it under their control. The tide always tilts one way or the other, but the ambivalent effect of constant conflict limits one side from taking absolute control.

## The Land

Olgizmar is divided between the north, inhabited by all the people and wizards who survived the demons, and the south, that is filled with demons, environmetal hazards and many disease outbreaks. The two parts are divided by wards placed shortly after the outbreak.

The south is divided into four provinces:

-The Frostrifts to the northeast and to north [[Kolnutt]] forest.
-Abyszbrána, the Balor's Turf, including south [[Kolnutt]] forest and [[Pyrlon]].
-Xraff, the hill tribes to the south cape.
-Krevřeka, the blood riverlands. up to [[Vyll River]].
