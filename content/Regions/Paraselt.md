## Description

Paraselt is one of the largest mountain ranges in all of [[Naerk]]. It starts from the south of the [[Green Hills]] and ends at the [[Ngamui Isles]]. Along the mountain range are several volcanoes, active mainly in the south. Of these, the best known is [[Kegrozal]], the volcano of the huge dragon [[Solusmeir]]. The rivers in Paraselt are few and several of them have dried up, resulting in the mountains being full of gorges.

The climate of the region is quite changeable, but if anything sums it up, it is the clouds. From the hazy clouds of the South turning into misty rain and the tan sandstorms coming from [[Windhill]], to the gray ash from volcanic activity, there is always a murky atmosphere. The constant change of wind keeps the temperature at relatively tolerable levels usually, but the changes are very sudden. In the west and north periodically falls a black rain, which is particularly acidic, as it destroys plants and corrodes buildings, while it burns the flesh. Its origin is still unknown.

## History

The Paraselt range already had a very bad reputation before the remnants of the [[Defeated Army]] settled there. Countless races of mountain goblins have inhabited it since ancient times, while there are even two linnorms, one black-red and one gray, who also inhabit the volcanic regions. To the northwest, Paraselt borders the wastelands of [[Rammok Wastes|Rammok]] in the Blackwater Marshes, a natural barrier to goblin raids into eastern [[Oromil]]. And for good reason as on various occasions the goblin tribes gathered and armed themselves in considerable numbers to raid. Most reach five feet in height, move at great speed, and in large numbers their attack is deadly. The main target of these attacks are the three remaining dwarven tribes, after fierce battles, who have turned to isolation and built thick, impenetrable walls in their places for protection. In recent years the goblins have rallied to [[Defeated Army]] and swore to revenge [[Green Hills]] for the great shamaness, [[Gorbla]] and their dead fellows at [[Battle of Fherlon Plains]].

## Relations

What few people know is that Paraselt has many secrets. It may be one of the most inhospitable and stifling regions to most, but below, in underground [[Deeps]] the mountain tribes of goblins and dwarves, as well as the [[Defeated Army]], are constantly forging stone and metal and crafting unique architectural designs for buildings, defenses, traps and weapons, since there is seldom peace between them. Many of the mountain paths, which the dwarves had carved into the granite in ancient times still exist, although some have been ruined by to volcanoes, landslides, or the destructive fury of the few Giants who dwell there.

Many say, and they are right, that the above dangers are nothing compared to those covered by the eastern side of the mountain range. Stories tell of undead creatures, made of lava and magma, and impregnable fortresses with flying warriors, sowing terror and death to anyone who approaches. Trade and travellers here are rare as well as dangerous in every way. On this side, in fact, there are several underground passages, which connect [[Naerk]] with other, lower dimensions used by unholy creatures, who come with destructive appetite. Only [[Hastaphar]] army and [[Keila]]'s elves hold this evil at bay but the constant fighting excerts a heavy toll on [[Tithlon]].

## [[Magma Star]]

Paraselt is ruled primarily by [[Magma Star]], a council in which the major goblin and giant factions are represented.
