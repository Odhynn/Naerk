## Description

[[Reisdok]] is big and narrow island west of [[Imtaria]]. Its capital, [[Kleyton]] differs vastly from the rest of the region. In addition to the many natives, who are at best prejudiced against the urban people, there are also many lairs of kobolds, who even use trained dinosaurs to raid and pillage the countryside. These warbands are organized by various local tribes, as well as priests of [[Sseratush]], who want to permanently eradicate the "Kleyton Contamination", as they call it, from the area.

[[Kleyton]] on the other hand is a huge trade and commercial center and home to [[Azarak]] Arcane Academy and [[Cornuzel]] wizards. Mages come from every part of the world here to study magic. The magical wonders of the city are many and unimaginable.

## History

The native warbands have long given up attacking Kleyton. In the last centuries, the island has suffered pirate attacks every several years and also threats from water monsters.

Reisdok joined [[Palaurim]], the trade treaty of [[Imtaria]], at year 3998 under special terms. This was frowned upon by many natives and local rulers, because taxation increased, without increasing the revenue from trade at the same time. Kleyton, according to many, was already in very good development rate and there was no need to enter this alliance, even on the preferential terms it did (1/4 less taxation). Many council members resent that option, and some are preparing a draft negotiation that includes even softer terms. Of course, no one knows if Imtaria will accept it.
