Selanaar, also referred to as the Kingdom of Selanahr, was an ancient empire that encompassed the entire continent of [[Athalaar]] before its collapse under the apocalyptic events of the Harrowing of Athalaar.

It developed probably around the 1st millenium after the [[Ghost War]], around the elven cosmic observatory and astral passage of [[Eltirion]], hence its name that is etymologically linked to the moon.

## History

Selanaari culture was based on a multiracial multiclass system of elven, dwarven, human, gnomish races and noble, mage, warrior, merchant, artisan, sailor, farmer, herder castes respectively.
Throughout its history, the elves maintained a leading position until their empire suffered from a catastrophic internal crisis during the late 17th century. What exactly happened is hard to ascertain with certainty, as even then the people of Selanaar were aloof and secretive to foreigners.

The only record by contemporary Imtarian merchants was one local rumor that "the elves were at fault"; that would indicate some dramatic development within or because of Eltirion, given that the crisis ended with the dwarves cordoning its immediate mountainous area off to contain whatever transpired there.
As the dwarves subsequently found themselves at the helm of the kingdom of Selanaar for the next 1500 years, the elves gradually disappeared from the spotlight.

In the wake of the Winter's War, in the early 3260s, Selanaar suddenly stopped interacting with the Northern Lands. The seas around Athalaar began to rage unceasingly.
Ships attempting to sail beyond the archipelago of Alagon to see what became of Athalaar would never return, while the isles' inhabitants themselves (largely made up of pirate states) told apocalyptic tales of its fate. The second internal crisis of Selanahr must have been an extinction event that wiped it off the cultural map
and created the Harrowlands.
