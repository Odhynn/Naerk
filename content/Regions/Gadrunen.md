The greatest empire of the giants, spreading from [[Hoen]] and North [[Oventhart]] to the reaches of [[Belgosreim]]. Their race was originally storm, mountain, frost and tundra giants that built colossal structures, hundreds of yards tall.

The empire declined steadily over the centuries. They could not match the reproductive rates of the other, smaller races, so even small drops in their population took years to replenish, and they often faced problems due to lack of food. Often this results in a permanent disposition to expand into more fertile areas, but here their third great disadvantage came into play: they were particularly self-centered and proud, and found it particularly difficult to follow orders and submit to hierarchical structures. This was ultimately the main factor that led to the downfall of their empire. Its remnants now lie on [[Hoen]] mountains, where the [[Tronerdim]] capital still stands.
