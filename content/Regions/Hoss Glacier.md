A great glacier north of [[Hoen]] and [[Korhond]]. It is unnatural cold and home only to the most daring travellers. Frost giants and snow goblins roam these lands, as well as wendigo undead that [[Totem War|appeared]] during [[Winter's War]]. Numerous ley lines cross the glacier and converge at the ice palace of [[Fol'rish]]: full of fey and elementals, stands out as a unique magical wonder that holds great power over the frozen wastes. The icy winds that blow travel from the vast depths of the North. Very few have mapped this area, and even fewer have traveled north of the [[Foljatar]] range. Thus, it can hardly be said how the huge glacier of Hoss, which descends to the border of [[Korhond]] and [[Hoen]] and has enormous effects in all areas, has been created.

Before the Winter's War, however, the glacier barely reached as far as [[Ofsån]]. The climate in the surrounding area was much warmer, and to the east of [[Åperbung]] there was a relatively fertile, by northern standards, valley between the mountain ranges. However, as the temperature began to drop, large masses of water solidified on the northern side of [[Foljatar]], and slowly began to expand southward. The area had a lot of water, so when it started to freeze, the area it covered swelled quickly. Many residents abandoned their settlements and fled southwest and southeast. Even in the south, the icy winds quickly made living along the frozen [[Folumb]] River a daily struggle for survival, while by the end of the Winter's War the glaciers had almost reached the [[Volosherg]] Forest. These events caused the [[Totem War]], at the border with [[Korhond]] for several weeks.

With the end of the Winter's War, glaciers began to gorge, rift and melt in the south, causing Åperbung to double in size and fill the area with hidden gorges, streams and rivers. The glacier remains within the confines of the four battered Wendigos, whose corpses are still preserved and protected by powerful runes. Many locals believe that their existence is bad luck, and they can come to life at any time. Others think they would do well to stay where they are, and discourage the younger ones from venturing to touch the mighty relics.
