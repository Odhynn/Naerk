Karrokh was among the later cultures that humans developed. The region could and did favor its development for many reasons. It was away from the various power games of the south, did not take part in the conflicts between the rest of the countries, and a significant part of it in the west could support enough agriculture to cover its needs. Thus, it developed a character of relative neutrality and autonomy.

Simultaneously, as the rest of the countries around were making wars and alliances, trade flourished greatly in the region given its location. Daily, merchant ships carrying food, building materials, supplies, spices and metals were constantly leaving and arriving at the ports of [[Gar'ahor]], [[Vaensir]], [[Tas-Roch]], [[Turanfa]], [[Tas-Rae]], and [[Kindasir]]. At inland there were many tribes of gnoll, skinwalkers and kobolds, and the [[Warclaw]] were very powerful there, but they too soon realized the advantages of trade and adapted accordingly. At the same time, three wizard guilds were established in [[Vaensir]] and two powerful priesthoods with entire networks of temples, one in [[Tas-Meir]] and one in [[Raenkos]]. This magical power was enough to secure the country from raids.

As a consequence of this situation, on the one hand, large cities were built, with a unique architectural rhythm and functionality, but on the other hand, there was no specific center of power that could define a way of government for the entire country. Everyone was afraid to oppose the magicians and priests and lawlessness and the development of trade inevitably led to the flourishing of piracy. The pirates maintained very good relations and contacts with [[Zolkar]], while at the same time limiting their activity within the islands and near the coast of Karokh, where they went on the ports just to sell their stolen goods.

[[Palaurim]]'s creation found [[Karrokh]] looking on indifferently. No one had much to gain by joining the pact, though they were certainly relieved that the countries around them had created a cordon that protected them from third-party attacks and invasions. Apparently [[Imtaria]] and [[Oromil]] pushed Karrokh hard enough to enter the agreement, but to the extent that the wizard elders, clan chieftains, high priests, and pirate captains disagreed and were negative, the Palaurim lands understood that it was not worth the trouble to force them to join, as long as that they did not create a particular problem for them apart from occasional piracy.

That was, though, a long procedure. If there was one thing everyone in Karokh ranked very highly, it was their autonomy in their own city-states. Eventually they all turned their fire against the pirates, demanding that they stop their raids on alliance ships. However, as merchants, wizards, and priests began raiding the pirate fleets, the kobolds found opportunity to expand into the beautiful cities and palaces of the west, and the warclaw into the fertile plains of the east. The situation quickly escalated, and armed clashes broke out across the territory.

Very quickly, the wiser ones realized that the situation was leading to an impasse. Among them was one of the two priesthoods, that of [[Lainek]], supported by [[Berenfaer]] forces. This was surprisingly addressed to the whole country, mainly in the west, and was made up of very many refugees. The six high priests concluded that the only way to end this confrontation is to have a council that understands the mutual problems, demands and needs of each side, and makes decisions with equal participation of all. As crops began to burn, refugees gathered and famine began, everyone understood that this would be the best solution.

Hostilities ceased at the end of that year with the Treaty of Understanding. According to this treaty, the freedom of each city-state is guaranteed, as well as its participation in the council, but as a condition there is a deep knowledge of the consequences of each of his actions, because in this way a chain reaction can be created that will bring unpredictability dissatisfaction and ultimately conflict. Overtime, they all saw the wisdom of this proposal, and agreed to it, while the council, held turn and turn about at [[Gar'ahor]] and [[Vaensir]] every month, decides on all matters, and consists of twelve hundred envoys in a vast hall.

The existence of the Treaty of Understanding led to a slow but steady prosperity of the country. Kobolds for the first time began to coexist with people in cities. Gnolls joined pirate crews, which made fewer and more targeted attacks. Wizards visited the kobold camps, and overall there was a lot of population change. The sale of slaves was significantly restricted, until it was banned, and this situation led to the unprecedented uniqueness of the Karrokh.

Today, Karrokh is presented by its visitors as a free country, very different from the others. The kindness of the inhabitants and their morals are said to be unique, and extend to foreigners to a great extent. Some who do not know say that it is ready to start a war with itself, others that it is not even a country, that it is a jumble of cultures without any values or ethics. Others present to them that they live on the remains of [[Palaurim]], that there are many robbers gathered together. And most of them condone the gnoll and skinwalker offensives to the east. In any case, however, this country's experiment seems to be holding up well for a millennium and a half, and given the declining situation in [[Palaurim]], it has little to envy.
