## History

In the early days, Green Hills were ravaged constantly by pillagers and invaders, mainly from the south. Green Hills rose to a great fertile kingdom after repeling gnoll attacks from [[Rammok Wastes]] and [[Karrokh]] and goblin attacks from [[Paraselt]]. Many mighty castles were built to defend the land, including [[Ostrabit]] and [[Dargonast]]. It is the birthplace of demigods [[Hansa]], [[Factar]] and [[Laerion]], the last of whom became the first king of the country.

## Laws

The leadership in Green Hills strongly believe in honor and justice. Summoning of fiends is forbidden, as is communicating with them, under punishment of exile or even death.

## Relations

There is an ongoing struggle to repel invaders from the [[Defeated Army]] that constantly attack from Paraselt.

Green Hills joined Palaurim but left after their envoy at South Trade Route was killed, with [[Imtaria]] to blame.
