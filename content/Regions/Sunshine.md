Sunshine is one of the few places on [[Naerk]] that the passage of time has touched so little. Its inhabitants have preserved the manners, customs, dialect and traditions of ancient times. And this cause the natives lived in the shadow of one of the most powerful and great dragons to walk upon Na'erk: The golden dragon [[Nentha]] "the wise".

Nentha's exploits and battles are too numerous to write here and are lost to the millennia. On the island however peace and security have always prevailed. The very existence of the dragon could discourage any pirate, invader and conqueror from even approaching the waters of Sunshine.

Nentha was recognized by the inhabitants themselves as the natural master of the place, and so intense was his aura of protection he inspired that no one felt oppressed by his presence. He made laws in the region, which were particularly fair to the great majority of the inhabitants, and even crimes were soon considerably reduced, as people slowly developed solidarity and healthy competition. The island's ideals of equality and justice have been developed and maintained over the centuries, with the dragon ensuring they are upheld as a living element of the place's history. To uphold the peace in [[Misty Sea]], an order of dragon knights was formed.

Sunshine also includes a complex of temples inhabited by many devotees of gods of justice, such as [[Sigard]] and [[Laerion]], and is also the base for [[Dragonpact]]. The superstructure of Dragonpact, erected with huge columns and arches was made thousands of years ago and also includes the palace and residence of Nentha himself, known as the Halls of Wisdom: [[Gaulgir]].
