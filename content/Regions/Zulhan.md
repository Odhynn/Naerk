## Description

A vast empire that extended over the whole of the present plain of [[Marelthia]] as well as all the southern half of [[Allwick]].

## Origin

Zulhan's prime was difficult. Dragons sowed terror in towns and villages, while battles between mighty beings were a frequent occurrence at the ancient times. In order to survive, the people of the empire built vast underground cities in the [[Deeps]], stretching hundreds of miles underground, away from the dangers of the surface.

## Firefolk and Rise

In the underground foundations of their civilisation, they found a new race already living there: the Firefolk. The first contact of the two peoples was peaceful. Both sides agreed that they could coexist with mutual understanding. Soon, relations between the two peoples improved. Trade flourished, and soon they appointed a supreme council that made decisions with the mutual participation of the most powerful families. They built unique architectural monuments above and below ground: From temples and academies to towers and huge palaces.

## Decline

The first problem was caused by [[Il'vec]]. When the [[Lucust Blight]] began to ravage everything from north to south, Zulhan sent a massive army of mages and horsemen to deal with it, as all crops and life in its wake perished. With the help of druids and deeds, they were able to destroy her material being, but the damage was already done. The area her flock had passed through had been irreversibly deserted. Soon, a plague broke out in the kingdom. Four princes migrated north with a large part of the population, and built a city, [[Eagle's Reach]].

The rest who remained faced famine for many years. After a decade, they managed to recover, but only a tenth of the population remained. Most of the crops were destroyed, and a second migration wave appeared. They migrated south, and created the present-day kingdom of [[Marelthia]].

After the second wave of immigrants, the decline of the capital began. Its population remained stable, but after three generations they could no longer match their ancestors' achievements in magic, science, and the arts. Things took a turn for the worse in the year 104, when [[Talkeri]], of the powerful Ferames family, took over as council prince on behalf of the surface dwellers. They were famous for their wealth and arrogance, as well as for blood feuds between related persons, as was probably the case with Talkeri. [[Talkeri]] an intelligent, sociable and beautiful child, but he had a very bad temper. He was often sick with pneumonia and flu, while he constantly suffered from tuberculosis that could not be cured, despite the efforts of medics.

At that time, on the Firefolk side, [[Teeso]] of the Lavarami family had taken over his duties two years ago. He was also young in age, and loved adventure and action. In the council, however, the balance was delicate, as there was constant disagreement over who was to blame for the kingdom's decline. But the firefolk had the least share of responsibility, as not many of their people had migrated and continued to help the rest as they could. Then Talkeri's tuberculosis was about to get worse.

The Ferames did not hesitate to blame the Lavarami. They claimed that they had cursed the prince with dark magic in order to have a majority of the council. Therefore, whatever happened to his health, they would be solely responsible. Teeso then, despite realizing the absurdity behind it all, vowed to find a way to cure him, and not return until then. The council would be balanced again, and if he could cure him, the Ferames would be obliged to drop the charges. And his proposal, despite the objections of his own people, was accepted.

Many at the time understood that this oath meant Teeso's banishment for life. But he had sworn in his blood and he intended to keep his oath. At the same time, it seemed at that moment probably the only way to stop the confrontations on both sides, even if only for a while. And so Teeso began his journey. He traveled to the south, to the east, to the west, and to the north, with many hardships and adversities. His final destination was [[Eagle's Reach]], after three months of fruitless wandering.

There, one of the four princes gave him a [[Philosopher's Stone]]: A stone that, according to him, could grant eternal life to its wearer. Teeso took it and returned to Zulhan. He found Talkeri dying: He was coughing up blood, his chest barely rising and falling, and the efforts of the best doctors and priests had only prolonged his suffering. Everyone stepped aside as Teeso took out the stone and placed it against Talkeri's chest.

Then, Teeso found that he could not let go of the stone from his hands, and remembered the words of the prince from Eagle's Reach: Eternal life would be given to the user of the stone, and it was he himself who had used it. Even worse, he had hidden from him that the stone had a price of one life for one life. Talkeri, then, paled as the stone took on a dark hue and began to suck his life energy: Within moments, the prince was dead, and Teeso fell dazed to the ground, unable to realize what had just happened. Everyone around him was frozen.

## Civil War

The ensuing civil war shattered what was left of the kingdom. Within hours, most of the Ferames and Lavarami were dead.

## Aftermath

Teeso galloped toward Eagle's Reach, enraged and thirsting for revenge on the alchemist prince who had deceived him. But Talkeri didn't really die.[[Voolthow]] found his soul. and within him the thirst for life, the thirst for power, and enveloped him in his dark magic, taking the sacrifice of all the souls that died in his name. And by the evening of that day, a new terror was to rise from the ruins of the now former empire. He had in his hands an entire army of undead, from the souls of the dead, a gift from the Shadow God: The [[Shadowflame Army]].
