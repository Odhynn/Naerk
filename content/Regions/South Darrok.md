## History

The country was the part of [[Darrok]] that was south of the [[Tarhelm]] mountain range. South [[Darrok]] had many trade relations with the kingdom of [[Kultaria]], but kept a completely neutral stance in [[Brother's War]]. It continued strengthening the alliance with [[Imtaria]], and that was when the first crack with the North took place. When [[North Darrok]] sought disobedience in the year 4581, a full-scale civil war started. This forced those who condemned this alliance to a defeat and they sought refuge in the foothills of Tarhelm. As for the rest of the south, they quickly elected a ruler who fully agreed to Imtaria's terms, and rumor has it that he agreed on even more conditions than they asked for, worsening the already war-torn lives of the inhabitants.

However, with the help of the [[[Palaurim]]] countries and the growth of trade, the southern Darrok quickly recovered. Its growth was accelerated by the development of agriculture and trade, as the inhabitants were able to sow undisturbed in the vast valleys. South Darrok currently has 10 councelors in Palaurim.

## Culture

Most scholars believe that South Darrok has renounced most of its traditions from the old Darrok. They have adopted many southern customs, a result of the trade and contact with [[Imtaria]] and [[Palaurim]].
