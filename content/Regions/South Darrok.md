## History

The country was the part of [[Darrok]] that was south of the [[Tarhelm]] mountain range. South [[Darrok]] had many trade relations with the kingdom of [[Kultaria]], but kept a completely neutral stance in [[Brother's War]]. It continued strengthening the alliance with [[Imtaria]], and that was when the first crack with the North took place. When [[North Darrok]] sought disobedience in the year 4581, a full-scale civil war started. This forced those who condemned this alliance to a defeat and they sought refuge in the foothills of Tarhelm. As for the rest of the south, they quickly elected a ruler who fully agreed to Imtaria's terms, and rumor has it that he agreed on even more conditions than they asked for, worsening the already war-torn lives of the inhabitants.

However, with the help of the [[[Palaurim]]] countries and the growth of trade, the southern Darrok quickly recovered. Its growth was accelerated by the development of agriculture and trade, as the inhabitants were able to sow undisturbed in the vast valleys.

A few years after the [[Darrok]] Civil War and subsequent split, the southern part still faced numerous challenges. Many farmers saw their crops burned and plundered while trade had practically stopped. Imtaria supported the governor [[Reynald]] who had settled in [[Llykavann]] and gradually began introducing a series of laws for the southern Darrok so that the country could recover. Their final form was presented in the year 4586.

The laws included strengthening the country's trade and cavalry. Taxation rose in various ways, but many goods were made more accessible with the establishment of permanent caravans across the length and breadth of Darrok's mainland. The main road connected [[Llykavann]] with [[Irmast]], [[Goldencape]] and [[Ekteron]], with a second connecting [[Lamerpad]] with [[Sapurr]], again via Irmast. The one hundred and twenty lords of the country received special tax breaks for breeding horses and for the manufacture and sale of weapons and armor. But [[Reynald]] was also called upon to solve other problems that had arisen.

Llykavann had become the new capital of South Darrok for two main reasons: The first was that it was the closest city to [[Imtaria]] and its merchant ships and caravans could reach it more easily. The second was that it was also the safest area during the civil strife, a few years before during the secession from the north. However, it remained a city that had grown suddenly, it did not have a specific shape and its streets remained narrow and unpaved. At the same time, the city had low wooden walls and only the governor's tower was a complete structure.

This was the state of South Darrok when suddenly, one morning, the people of Llykavann saw the banners of Arbader's army marching to the south. In fact, this invasion had been in preparation for a long time. In the decline of [[Darrok]] after the civil war, the rising power of [[Arbader]] and [[Hasnev]] found an excuse to expand. But that was not the only reason: In the [[Queenswood]], the forest east of Llykavann, there was a grove of trees that were sacred to the city: The first queen of Darrok had walked there and carved trees with silver and precious stones. The value of these trees was incalculable, obviously in the case of Hasnev not for sentimental but for financial reasons.

Thus started the [[Decade War of Arbader and South Darrok]]. Thousands died from both sides in the numerous battles, but ten years later the country was able to regain most of its lost territory and pushed Arbader south once again.

South Darrok currently has 10 councelors in Palaurim.

## Culture

Most scholars believe that South Darrok has renounced most of its traditions from the old Darrok. They have adopted many southern customs, a result of the trade and contact with [[Imtaria]] and [[Palaurim]].
