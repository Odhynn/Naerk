## Origin

Darrok as a region was one of the oldest inhabited, and had little expansionary tendencies. The gigantic [[Tarhelm]] mountain range created a physical barrier to communication between north and south, and as a result the cultures that developed in these two regions were completely different.

## Relations

The south had many trade relations with the kingdom of [[Kultaria]], but kept a completely neutral stance in [[Brother's War]]. It continued strengthening the alliance with [[Imtaria]], and that was when the first crack with the North took place. The [[North Darrok|North]] consisted of barren lands, three fortress cities, mountaineers, orcs, dwarves and some barbarian tribes. Most of all, the inhabitants valued their independence, and were among the first to understand the corruption and exploitation in the vast empire of Imtaria and its allied states of [[Palaurim]].

## Dispute

The seed of disobedience passed through the year 4581 in [[South Darrok]] as well, but to a very limited extent. This resulted in a full-scale civil war, which forced those who condemned this alliance to a defeat and they sought refuge in the foothills of Tarhelm. As for the rest of the south, they quickly elected a ruler who fully agreed to Imtaria's terms, and rumor has it that he agreed on even more conditions than they asked for, worsening the already war-torn lives of the inhabitants. However, with the help of the [[[Palaurim]]] countries and the growth of trade, the southern Darrok quickly recovered. Its growth was accelerated by the development of agriculture and trade, as the inhabitants were able to sow undisturbed in the vast valleys.

The north, on the contrary, went through a very difficult period. A series of unexplained violent storms hit the region hard. Food was scarce, while simultaneously they wanted to help the wave of refugees from the south. At the same time, a decade of embargo was already taking place, the Palaurim fleet restricting trade and routes of ships in the bays of [[Mheir]] and [[Skator]]. This made the situation even worse, for in North Darrok they had a lot of commercial exports in metals, salt, weapons and precious stones. However, they were slowly able to find a balance and meet their needs by organizing an oligarchic form of government with a council that included representatives from the dwarves, settled refugees, mountaineers, and fort generals. Even then, because of the orcs and barbarian raids, peace is an unknown word in Tarhelm but the situation has improved thereafter.

Neither region wanted to let go of the country's name first, so both have kept it to this day. But if one observes the way the people of Darrok live now in the north and the south, they will probably admit that the manners, customs and dialect in the north have been conserved much more.
