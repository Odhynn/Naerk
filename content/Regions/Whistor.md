## History

During [[King Raldon]]'s reign, in the previous century, the country flourished with its trade and navy reaching unprecedented heights. It became a major point in South Trade Route and its ports a mandatory stop and a safe haven for all [[Palaurim]] merchants. Eventually, the [[Pirate Council]] also started medling with the country's increasing wealth, as pirates began attacking merchant ships. At first, [[Whistor Pirate Hunt]] was succesful and the pirates fled for a brief period. Unfortunately, king Raldon's increasing paranoia failed to deal with the pirates, enabling them to put their own Counselor Lady [[Della]] to the palace and taking the king's sons as prisoners. After a coup d'etat led by several generals and [[Kuthnor]], Della and Raldon were thrown into prison. They managed to escape and immediately open war broke out between Whistor and the pirates.
