Whistor currently has 2 councelors in [[Palaurim]].

## History

During [[King Raldon]]'s reign, in the previous century, the country flourished with its trade and navy reaching unprecedented heights. It became a major point in South Trade Route and its ports a mandatory stop and a safe haven for all [[Palaurim]] merchants. Eventually, the [[Pirate Council]] also started medling with the country's increasing wealth, as pirates began attacking merchant ships. At first, [[Whistor Pirate Hunt]] was succesful and the pirates fled for a brief period. Unfortunately, king Raldon's increasing paranoia failed to deal with the pirates, enabling them to put their own Counselor Lady [[Della]] to the palace and taking the king's sons as prisoners. After a coup d'etat led by several generals and [[Kuthnor]], Della and Raldon were thrown into prison. They managed to escape and immediately open war broke out between Whistor and the pirates.

## Country without a King

With [[King Raldon]] out of the picture, General [[Kuthnor]] Ascado took on the difficult task of getting Whistor into a state where it could be effectively defended against pirates. But this goal faced many obstacles. First of all, after a detailed inventory, a huge amount of the palace's wealth was missing from the raid on the royal treasury, almost half. In addition, many people had lost faith in the throne, so Kuthnor refused to proclaim himself king.

His task was particularly difficult: The army may have been numerically strong and properly equipped, but he had to solve huge logistic puzzles to supply it at regular intervals. The fleet was spread out in three points around Whistor, and ships constantly had to be sent with supplies. The warriors also had to be trained in maneuvers and complex orders, as most were completely inexperienced young men. All of this took time, which Kuthnor certainly did not have.

[[Della]] had already begun her moves: She had gone to [[Sjemhe]] and [[Almarica]] in disguise and had begun to turn public opinion against Kuthnor. Many believed that the general had taken advantage of the situation to seize the throne, while many were tricked into the belief that Della was the only one who could save the island from a bloody conflict. Her next move was to convince the [[Pirate Council]] not to attack Whistor until she had prepared the situation, but in that regard her plans were ruined.

Among the pirates who disagreed was Captain [[Valus]] from [[Flame Gulf]]. A cruel and sadistic leader, he believed that Whistor should not be given time to organize its army, and he feared that Della would take all the spoils of the island alone. Already, only a small portion of the king's treasury had ended up in Valus' hands, and he had every reason to suspect her.

Without warning, the first battles began in [[Malgoryn]] to the north and on the [[Walgri Isles]]. Losses were enormous on both sides, but Valus gradually gained the advantage, as he was an experienced captain, while eventually he had enough undead among his sailors that the mere sight of them made Whistor's young warriors dive into the sea. Fifty of Whistor's galleys were destroyed, while Valus lost only twenty-two smaller ones.

After this defeat, Della appeared at the palace and addressed Kuthnor, telling him that she could help him if he appointed her as an advisor. Trapped in the face of the gradual destruction of his fleet, Kuthnor accepted, and Della began to learn Valus' plans and reveal them to Kuthnor. As a result of which his fleet was always prepared in the points where Valus attacked. Valus in turn, unable to identify the spy in his ranks, stopped the attacks, leaving Whistor unofficially ruled by a general and an advisor that few had imagined and even fewer trusted.
