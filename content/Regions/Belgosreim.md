A cold, inhospitable tundra full of great linnorms, frost giants, goblins and orc nomadic tribes. Home to the dreadful acolytes of [[Twilight Veil]]. On the western shores lies the whaler town of [[Clapten]]. Kraken and other sea monsters have plagued these frozen reaches and there are [[Lokkam Kraken|many instances]] of such attacks on ships and ports.
