Athalaar is a misty and mysterious landmass lying to the northwest of the continental Old World.
The earliest records of it originate from the prehistoric times when the elves first walked upon Naerk. They named her Athalaar, which roughly translates to "moon storm", drawing inspiration perhaps from the unpredictable weather and the high tides.
There had been a draconic name for these foggy lands, which was unfortunately not preserved in the limited literary sources of that age, and the few dragons who remember it still are silent on the matter.

It was the elven sages and mages of old that first investigated Athalaar's peculiar ties with the moon, namely the older one of the globe's satellites known as [[Qusm]] or Cosmodrome.
It is so far unknown when exactly Eltirion (translating to "Tower of Stars") was constructed in the highest mountains at the center of the continent, but a decent estimation would be between -2000 to -1600.
The observatory-palatial complex set up there by the elves acted as a projection focus point to the Cosmodrome in such a way that it functioned as a gateway to other worlds.

As millennia passed, in Eltirion's shadow developed the civilization of [[Selanaar]].

The gnomes partially survived the disaster; fortified in the southernmost peninsula of Athalaar, they persevered for centuries surrounded by haunted lands and impassable seas, creating the state of [[Kwarix]] where they have continued to progress ever since, inheriting the most advanced secrets of Selanaar. Presently, Kwarix is synonymous with research in clockwork technology to the few scholars around the world who know of it.

Another ethnic group that managed to eke out a living in the newly haunted continent throughout the centuries were the [[Athar]] orc tribes, huddled around protective circles and menhirs in the eastern woodlands and hills under the leadership of their shamans.

The barbarian settlers to the northeast proved to be surprisingly resilient group as well. Part of the seed of Thimvert, cut off from the rest of the world and after centuries of fighting against the elements, oni, ogres and orcs, they consolidated their hold over the land they called [[Bjåglant]].
Over the course of the 48th century the ring of eternal storm around the shores of Athalaar broke off and gradually receded; with the seas now tranversable, the Bjåglanders didn't take long to rediscover their ancestors maritime ferocity.

In 4890, the [[Sennarin|Sennarii]] clans, refugees of a disaster in the Realms Beyond, appeared through the ancient elven cosmic portals in the now eponymous region, where they established themselves and expanded after many years of conflict with the Bjåglanders as well as the creatures that the Bjåglanders and the Athar had already been fighting off for the previous 1200 years.
The art and culture of these people is eerily similar to that of old Selanaar. Hypotheses outlining the possible influence of Selanaar to (or from) the Realms Beyond are increasingly alluded to in light of the recent Sennarii expeditions into the haunted heartland of the ancient kingdom.
