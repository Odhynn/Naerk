## History

The history of Korhond is lost in the centuries before the first cities and the development of trade. Its roots go back to the first humans, six and a half millennia ago. In ancient times, the North was an assembly place for many tribes, who fought for territorial claims and access to hunting and later, for reasons of honor, vendetta and revenge. When orcs came from the east and began to expand into the area, the conflicts became even more fierce. The orcs and humans that survived were either the strongest and most resistant to hardships, either those that hid in mountains, caves and glaciers, or those that were able to form alliances and call upon them in times of invasion or war.

The first tribes settled after many hardships in the foothills of Hlafentar, as well as in the forests of present-day Fervolosh. A great [[siege of Hlafengrond|siege]] took place at the [[Gadrunen]] fort of Hlafengrond. After that, the giants lost their strongest base and center of power in Korhond.

The ancient North had infinite dangers. On one hand the goblins and hobgoblins, who were already in Hlafentar and the forest and were constantly raiding the rest, with no inclination to share their territories with others. On the other hand, numerous wild beasts, which still sow terror in the North. The danger of both predators and many herbivores left no place in the Korhond where one could feel safe. The groups that hunted some of them out of necessity were made up of people who did not always belong to the same tribe, so they formed strong friendship bonds. And finally, there were Giants from the Empire of Gadrunen, who had settlements and fortresses on the mountains and could scatter in their wake entire armies of the bravest warriors.

Their very enemies indicated to the Northerners with whom they could ally themselves. The common dangers they faced forced them to create relationships of recognition and trust between them, often out of necessity, a necessity that eventually became a habit. However, before a more permanent solution could be established, a catalytic intervention was needed that could significantly reduce the merciless skirmishes and battles that had stained the northern snow red.

And this factor was none other than the Aspects. Creatures of nature, the strongest servants of Malahir, the Aspects may have had many disagreements with each other, but they all had as their ultimate goal the establishment of harmony in the natural world and those who respected it. The Aspects were particularly impressed by the bravery, endurance and morale of the Northerners, so they focused heavily their efforts in order to bring stability. At the same time, this was made possible by the contribution of several shamans, druids and nature priests, who had power in each faction and could very easily get along with others, even if they were servants of other Aspects. In the North, although there could be no total agreement, there could be respect.

The situation that forced the Northerners to unite happened when a great epidemic fell in the region. Also known as Feralga, the Wail, this disease contaminated the water and anyone who drank it had a serious chance of getting sick. The symptoms were constant stomach pains and vomiting, while the victim's blood turned black and poisoned. This epidemic caused all the healers and magic users to travel back and forth from tribe to tribe, thus strengthening their cooperation.

In later years, as many tribes were weakened, goblin incursions into the east became a very common occurrence. However, the Northmen, after some defeats, began to work together, many tribes together, so as to limit the power of the goblins. Three years later, the goblins were confined to Jargad's cape, while the allies built the Stone House. It was the first stone dwelling in the north, after the giants' wonders, and marked a period in which the daily slaughter had ceased, while at the same time the settlement of many tribes in permanent dwellings had been finalized.

When the most serious challenges of the Wail and the goblins were over, the Northmen emerged stronger than ever. This, combined with the recent alliances, led to the creation and establishment of the [[Vølrad]], the battle through which territorial and other disputes in Fervolosh are settled. [[Torniv]], the Stone House remains to this day the most important cultural place of Korhond and marks its unification in dire times, as well as its glorious history.

During the [[Winter's War]], menhirs were build by shamans and druids to stop wendigo attacks from [[Hoss Glacier]].

Hardships, adversities and skirmishes in the North with all sorts of two-legged or four-legged adversaries are daily, and only those accustomed to such a life can stay there for long.

## Northern Customs

Some of the more common customs and celebrations found in the north are described below.

**The First Prey:** With the start of the new year, hunters flock to a predetermined spot to catch the first game of the year. The one who turns back first is also the one who is considered the winner. The village elder (Galdosh) then slaughters the animal and often tells omens for the year, while the entire clan or village boils the meat and makes soup, which everyone eats. However, there is often a great feast, as by the time the winner is known others have returned with additional game, which is eaten at the feast that follows.

**The Missing Limb:** Many times when two families are at odds, a warrior from each is called to defend their honor in a duel. To prevent the gladiator from being targeted later, the two opponents often wear masks. The winner in the duel is the one who will first cut one limb from the other. Thus, the most common weapons are swords and axes. For many, it is considered one of the most barbaric customs, but the majority maintains that many have survived it and the vendetta stops there.

**Catch the Deer:** A typically teenage sport, involving a series of challenges. Two teams of four, six or eight people are formed, and each team must catch a deer alive. Then he must bring the deer to a pre-arranged place and tie it up and call out the signal. The other team then has to split its members into two: half to continue hunting a deer alive (the first phase of the process) and the other half to catch the other team's deer. When both teams complete the first phase, everyone dedicates themselves to catching the other team's deer. It is therefore particularly important in the first phase that the deer that will be caught is not seriously injured, to be able to run in the second. [[Valanshore]] worshipers say that the two stags are sacred, especially the stag caught last, and it is sacrilege in their eyes to kill them.

**Boat Without Oars:** A mobile celebration, which takes place a few days after the ice begins to melt, often near the vernal equinox. The smallest baby of the village sits in a small boat, and a pre-agreed number of swimmers gather. The swimmers are then roped to the boat, not allowed to touch it, and begin to swim a certain, fairly long course, dragging the boat. The goal is for the baby to get there without getting wet, which means it shouldn't dribble on ice or get splashed. The dishonor in case of failure is too great.

**Day of the Dead:** On 2 Coldreign, the celebration of the dead takes place. Each tribe celebrates it differently, but usually no one is allowed to eat anything except a certain type of mead, which often creates hallucinations, and allows its users to communicate with the [[Ethereal Plane]]. Its preparation remains secret in the circles of druids and shamans. Many magical and inexplicable things have happened on that day, which is a day of humility and remembrance of the past and the dead. This day is also the memorial of most families to their dead, and many look for them, with a hope of hearing a voice of their loved ones' soul from the [[Evergrowing Forest]]: A wish that sometimes gets fullfiled.

**The Last Harvest:** The autumnal equinox is "celebrated" in the north in a rather special way. Everyone is running throughout the day to gather supplies for the winter and complete whatever preparations they are making: From wood to provisions to roots, crops and spices. The only one not running is Galdosh, who is trying to coordinate the work of everyone else. Work continues at an intensive pace for the next few days until the first severe bad weather, where Last Harvest stops.

**Stranger at the Door:** During the summer solstice, a stranger knocks on the door of every house in the evening, usually from another village, often from another tribe. According to custom, the host must grant his wish. Usually, the stranger at the door is young men and women who go to the house of a person they are romantically attracted to, and ask for it: and the host is obliged to grant their wish, even if they have an enmity with that person. Invariably, the spread of this custom had to do with the degree of trust the tribes had with each other.

**Fall of the Mighty Worm:** In the year 4786, a colossal two-headed linnorm named [[Zuul]] [[Terror of the Lake|terrorized]] the shores of [[Åperbung]]. For weeks, it destroyed villages and killed inhabitants, until in an epic battle, on the 4th Moondance, it was killed by famous heroes. Since then, the day is celebrated with feasts in all the coastal settlements of the lake, where bards and poets come and recount heroic deeds of the past.

**Runestone Oath:** When one touches a [[Runestone]] of the [[Aspects]] and swears to it with his blood, his oath automatically becomes sacred throughout the North and his hand takes the symbol of that deed until its completion. He must keep it, and all who see the sign must respect his oath. At the same time the oath cannot violate the principles of this act, otherwise it is annulled. In the event that the oath is not kept, within the time frames that the [[Aspects|Aspect]] itself determines, then it in turn takes revenge on the one who took it, while in the event that someone unrelated to the oath tries to prevent its implementation, he receives the according wrath of this Aspect, as well as that of the whole North.
