## Pirates

Stormfall was originally nothing more than a small island with a few natives, mostly forest elves and bugbears. The barbarian raiders from [[Bj√•glant]] usually shunned it, as it lacked much loot to pillage. The elves frightened them with hallucinations and they had come to believe it was haunted. The pirates of [[Alagon]], though at first believing the same, afterwards began to visit it less and less, since it was nearer and their seas less dangerous from storms and ice.

Gradually, from the year 3272 the pirates built two villages in the west of the island, Zarketh in the south and Grayser in the west. They kept their distance from the elves, not wanting to provoke them. However, the elves, in an unprecedented move in their history, [[Stormfall Defence|allied]] themselves with the bugbears and coordinated a concerted attack on the villages with particular ferocity, resulting in the slaughter of the majority of the pirates.

## [[Imtaria]] Settlers

In the year 4228, an expedition from the west arrived in Stormsfall for the first time. They were a dozen ships from [[Imtaria]], whose unique construction of coralwood and Water Elemental assistance in propulsion enabled them to make this long journey from the islands of [[Urdankh]]. Imtaria, under a new emperor dynasty, was now trying to explore new areas and find traces of the lost [[Emperor Nahal II]]. The elves decided not to attack Imtaria's camp on the southern tip of the island, mostly because they were afraid of them. The warriors wore full armor from head to toe, and the uniformity of their colors and the order of their army was awe-inspiring. Even more, they had mages who within days had bolstered the camp's defenses with protective runes and walls that seemed to spring from the ground. Finally, the ships had huge crossbows with magical alchemical ammunition, which made bursts of fire.

The two attempts by the natives to attack were made a month later, and failed miserably. Their losses were twenty times that of the colonists. This defeat forced them to retreat deep into the forest as the Imtarians continued to expand. Soon, three towns were established in the south, one of which developed into the famous port of Oberos. In the following decades, other settlers came there, most of them unhappy with the corruption that had begun to appear within Imtaria, and the settlements expanded.

## Colony

Today, almost half of the island belongs to Imtaria, and remains a colony. However, the governors have imposed particularly strict martial laws, especially regarding piracy and the natives. Thus, pirates who come to trade first pass through Karan's Cross to "wash" their goods, and then come to the colonists' ports. The elves have disappeared into the depths of the forest and are rarely seen, while the bugbears have begun to cooperate with the pirates in various dirty jobs, mainly with slaves and smuggling. As for slavery, the Imtarians turn a blind eye because no one controls them there, while it is convenient for their own business.
